# Lesson Plan

## Morning

Get together briefly at around 10 am every morning to:

* Respond to students' self-assessment feedback
* Encourage students to keep thinking about and monitoring their learning.
* Go over the agenda for the day.
* Remind students to make good use of their time. If they finish the activities early then they should spend the rest of the time working on their own projects. 

## Lessons

I hope the terminology is not too confusing but by "lesson" I mean a lecture or an activity that is directly supervised by the instructor. 

An "exercise" involves students doing some exploration. An "exercise" could be in the form of a "fake" client request or just a prompt/question that points students in the general direction they should be heading. Of course these types of lessons involve a bit of chaos and that's a good thing!

### Type 1: Lesson

There are two possible ways of tackling the **lessons**.

1. Teacher led instruction
2. Student led instruction

The first option looks very much like a regular HackerYou part-time course and should be chosen by default. The second option should be chosen if a decent chunk of the students are already very familiar with the content.

**Why?**:

* lecture might frustrate students who know the material really well
* teaching is a great way to learn subtle concepts so students should get the opportunity
* students will get a chance to form bonds/friendships early


**Student led instruction**

* form groups of 2-3 students
* each group should have one student comfortable teaching
* groups go through the notes/problems with one student playing the role of teacher
* instructors circulate to answer questions


### Type 2: Exercise

This is a flipped version of a regular lesson. Instead of having notes to go through, students are given prompts/questions to guide their exploration. Students should work in groups to answer the questions.

Give students about 2/3 of the allotted time to work. In the last 1/3 portion, get everyone together to discuss their findings.

* Groups should present their findings and collaboratively form a class set of notes.
* If notes are available (some days they are) then briefly go through them to make sure that all topics were covered.
* Some students will have stumbled on some interesting topics; discuss them if there is time or make a note of them for a future lesson.

Some students will struggle in this environment. Talk to them to address their issues right away. The students need to be really comfortable doing exploration and research otherwise they will not survive as freelancers.
