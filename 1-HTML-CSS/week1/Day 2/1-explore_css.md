## Including CSS

* There are several ways of including CSS to style HTML elements. What are these approaches?
* What are the pros and cons of each approach?

## CSS Selectors

* How do you write a CSS rule that applies to all "p" elements on a page?
* How would you write a rule that only applies to the second paragraph?
* How would you write a rule that only applies to the first paragraph. You may change the markup by adding attributes.

## CSS Specificity

* What happens when you write two rules for a single element? Come up with some guidelines for predicting which rules apply.

## Pseudo Selectors
