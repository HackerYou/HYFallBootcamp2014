# Week 1, Day 5 Challenges

Throughout the course you will be presented with challenges that are intended to help you gain skills that web developers really need. You are encouraged to work in pairs for these challenges.


## Challenge 1
Unfortunately your client was working with an incompetent web developer before they found you. So your task today is to cleanup the mess. Sift through the code to find and fix bugs and "bad practices". Open "challenge_1.html" to get started.
	
## Challenge 2
Horizontally centring elements on the page is difficult but we covered how to do it. Your challenge is to centre an element both horizontally and vertically so that it's exactly in the centre of the page. The element has a fixed width and height to make things simpler. Open "challenge_2.html" to get started.
