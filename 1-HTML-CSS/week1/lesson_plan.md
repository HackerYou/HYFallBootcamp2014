# Type: Lesson

There are two possible ways of tackling this week's **lessons**.

1. Teacher led instruction
2. Student led instruction

The first option looks very much like a regular HackerYou part-time course. The second option should be chosen if a decent chunk of the students are already very familiar with the content.

**Benefits**:

* lecture might frustrate students who know the material
* teaching is a great way to learn subtle concepts
* students will get a chance to form bonds/friendships early


## Student led instruction

* form groups of 2-3 students
* each group should have one student comfortable teaching
* groups go through the notes/problems with one student playing the role of teacher
* instructors circulate to answer questions


# Type: Exercise

Day 2 and 5 involve "exercise" type activities. This is a flipped version of a regular lesson. Instead of having notes to go through, students are given prompts/questions to guide their exploration. Students should work in groups to answer the questions.

After the students are done answering the questions get everyone together to discuss their results:

* Groups should present their findings and collaboratively form a class set of notes.
* If notes are available (some days they are) then briefly go through them to make sure that all topics were covered.
