# Form Practice

## Problem 1

Open up `form.html` in your browser and you'll see a basic form similar to the one on twitter. Lets see how we can use CSS to match it to pretty much the exact style of twitter.

Most inputs and forms are just like any other element, so we can use whatever CSS we want on them.

Before we go on, we should note that at this time, you cannot style the look and feel of radio buttons, dropdown selects, file inputs, or checkboxes. There are sneaky Javascript ways to fake this, but no pure CSS solution.


## Problem 2

Getting the hang of both CSS and HTML with forms takes practice, open up `inputs-exercise.html` and work through the problems, matching both the HTML/functionality as well as the CSS look and feel.
