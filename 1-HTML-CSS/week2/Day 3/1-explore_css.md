# Explore CSS

In groups of 2-3 people use the following guiding questions to explore and learn about CSS. At the end of the exercise you will share your findings with the class. The class will then collaborate to form notes.

## Color

* There are six different ways of specifying colour in a CSS rule, what are they?
* Colour can be added to many different parts of an element. We can of course add colour to text but what other parts can we add colour to?

## Background

* How do you add an image as an element's background?
* How do we make background images only repeat along the X axis? Y axis?
* How do we add a background image that doesn't repeat but instead is positioned in the bottom right corner of the element?
* What if we want our background image to stay fixed in place while the text scrolls?
* Check out subtlepatterns.com for some nice background patterns.
* How do we create background gradients using only CSS?

## Typography

Some say that web design is 90% typography. Let's learn how to style our text.

* How do we change the font type for an element, let's say from the default browser type to "Helvetica".
* What does serif and sans-serif mean?
* What is a font stack?
* How do we change the font size?
* How do we make text bold or italic? What other styles are available?
* What is line-height? Why use it? What is the default line-height?
* How do we control the space in-between letters?
* How do we centre text? Align text to the right or left?
* Can we capitalize a word using CSS? How about making all letters lowercase or uppercase?

## Web Fonts

The fonts that we've been using so far are installed on the user's computer. CSS3 web fonts allow us to use custom fonts that are visually more appealing.

Check out [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts) to see some fonts that are hosted by Google. Experiment with the fonts to learn how to embed them.

## Text-shadow and box-shadow

With CSS3 we can add shadow to our elements to create great visual effects, take a look at the examples at [http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/TypographyStyles/index4.html](http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/TypographyStyles/index4.html)
