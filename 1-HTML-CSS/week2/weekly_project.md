# Weekly Project

This project is meant to call upon everything we have done so far. Like our last project, we are going to be creating a website from scratch. This one will be about the same difficulty level as the last one, just with more requirements based on what we have done previously.

You may choose to do your website on anything you wish. Here are some ideas:

* An online resume
* Try and recreate an existing website. A student last year replicated the hackeryou website.
* Site for a your own or a friends business
* Small site for a local charity

The layout is also 100% up to you, provided you include most/all of the below requirements. If you need some inspiration for the this project's layout, considering crafting the below layout or visiting these websites for ideas:

## You must have at least the following:

* When sizing the main divs - (header, general info, content, sidebar and footer in my example) - use percentages.
* 3 .html pages
* 1 external .css file
* box-sizing:border-box;
* CSS Normalize
* Clearfix
* 1 Dropdown navigation
* header div
* footer div
* Three divs that hold content (content and sidebar are two examples we have used so far)
* Two web fonts
* 5 CSS typography styles (text shadow, font size, family, color, transform, etc..)
* box shadow
* relative positioning (maybe bump your sidebar blocks slightly outside the wrapper?)
* absolute positioning (maybe have a twitter bird floating in the sidebar?)
* Embedded media (e.g. Youtube, Maps, Twitter, etc.)
* 1 background image
* 2 links within the page
* 1 Contact form


Since we spent quite a bit of time on forms, your form should:

* be functional. I.e. use Wufoo.com to receive the data that users submit through the form.
* have custom CSS styles (http://www.wufoo.com/2011/05/20/form-anatomy-custom-css/)

## Bonus points for

* Complex / unique layout
* Multi level dropdown nav
* CSS Gradients
* Use of RGBA() of HSLA()
* Creative use of Borders and border radius
* CSS3 animations (We didn't cover this yet, but do a search)

As always, this will not be graded, but I will ask you to hand it in for me to review.
