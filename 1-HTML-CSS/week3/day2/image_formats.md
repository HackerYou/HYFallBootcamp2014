#Working with Different Image Formats

There are several file types used for adding images to a web page. Each type is best suited for specific kinds of images. As a rule of thumb, use the format that maintains the best quality while reducing the file size.

## JPEG
jpg - used for photographs with lots of rich colours or gradients


## PNG
png - used for images with transparent or opaque backgrounds


## GIF
gif - used for images with minimal colour variation and of course, for animated gifs!


Here are some image place holder image sites:

http://placeimg.com/
http://placekitten.com/
http://placehold.it/


difference between png-8, png-24, jpeg, svg and when to use each
resizing images to appropriate dimensions before using them in a website
smushing tools (imgoptim for osx, svg cleaner)
what file size to aim for (eg. > 100kb is danger zone)
PS save for web (maybe?)
