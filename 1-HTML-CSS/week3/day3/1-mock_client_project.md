# Mock Client Project

We've already talked about finding and winning clients; in this exercise you will be using both your freelancing and technical skills to execute a mock client project. We have two "mock" clients for you to choose from:

### HackerYou

HackerYou needs a website; after much internal discuss they have decided to implement a website in three phases. In the first phase they want the overall design/feel of the website done as well two pages coded (**home** and **about-us**). In the later phases the blog and course pages will be added.

Phase one has started so they have design mockups. What they're looking for is a front-end web developer who can take the mockup images and turn them into an HTML/CSS website. Are you up for the job?

### Ladies Learning Code

Just like HackerYou, the Ladies Learning Code team wants their website built in multiple phases. They have the design mockups and would like to hire a front-end web developer to build the **home** and **about-us** pages in HTML/CSS. Are you up for the job?

## Step 1: Pitch

Your first task is to form groups of 3 and define the scope of the project. Of course you will need to price/quote the project. Ask the client for clarification if you feel that the request is ambiguous. When you feel you are ready to pitch your offer/quote, go ahead and talk to the client's representative.

## Step 2: Build

After you have pitched your plan you will receive a design package that you will (in the same group) turn into an HTML/CSS website.

* Your client is HackerYou or Ladies Learning Code. Talk to your client to ask clarifying questions and to get feedback through the building process.
* Each group will get an advisor (instructor or mentor). Talk to your advisor if you have a technical or freelance related question.

**Contents of Design Package**

* Mockups of the finished website.
* Guides that show you the dimensions of the website components.
* Cropped image assets to use for the website
* Extras: when possible you will get PSD (Adobe Photoshop) mockups.
