# Design Critique Exercise

As a group you will conduct a design critique. Take some of the websites that you have built so far and "put them under the microscope". How do the websites look and function now that you know a bit more about design?

The "POSSIBLE DISCUSSION POINTS / QUESTIONS TO USE" section of the following article might be handy: http://scottberkun.com/essays/23-how-to-run-a-design-critique/. Your design critiques should also consider typography, colour, white space, visual hierarchy, user experience, etc.
