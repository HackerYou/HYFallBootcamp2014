#Style Guides

To help you turn your design ideas into beautiful CSS, it's helpful to have a step in between your vision and the finsihed product. We use style guides to test our ideas and establish a soild design direction. They will also help you to build modularly, which makes your CSS more lean and organized.

##Style Guide How To

###Collect Inspiration
Take screen shots or use a bookmarking service (like Evernote) to collect snippets of things you like. They can be from websites, design resources (colourlovers palette, google web fonts), or just anything you find appealing.

Here are some of the things I collected when designing my own website:

Not everything made the cut, but you can see how some elements translated into the finish product:

###Establish a Colour Scheme
Pull some colours that you like out of what you've collected. 

Open `style-guide.html` and try editing and adding to the colour swatches. This will give you a preview of how all your colours work together. Keep editing until you find something you love! If you're using Sass, you can create and .scss file and start keeping those colours in variables for later.

###Create a Typography Heirarchy
Web design relies quite heavily on typography, so it's important to nail that down.
