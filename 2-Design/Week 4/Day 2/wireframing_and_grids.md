# Wire-framing and Grids

How do you go about designing a website? Should you start in Photoshop? draw on paper? or maybe code right away?

The answer is do what works for you. If you already have a workflow that works for you (especially if you're a graphic designer) then you can stick to it. On the other hand, if you don't have a workflow yet then try the following:

**Step 1.** Think about the goal of the website. Who are the target audience? What content needs to be included? What action do you want the audience to take? etc.
**Step 2.** Get out a piece of paper and a pen and start drawing rough sketches. The sketches serve as mockups and wireframes for the website. The focus of the wireframe should be on information/content placement while taking into consideration how the users will interact with the content.

**Exercise**

In groups of 2-3 draw sketches/wireframes on a piece of paper of a simple one page website. As a group decide what the website will be for (e.g. Web application landing page, restaurant homepage, personal portfolio, etc.). 

Start by answering the questions in "step 1". You should understand why the website exists and how it's going to fulfill its function/purpose.

**Step 3**. Use a grid system to code the wireframe. What's a grid? The next activity will help with that.

## Grids

As you have noticed, hackdesign.org is a curator of the best web design resources. They point us to some excellent resources that summarize and crystallize web design best practices. Today we're going to be using lesson 32 from hackdesign.org called "Designing with Grids".

> In groups of 2-3 do the following readings, collaboratively create notes to summarize your learning, have discussions and complete the exercises.  As a group you need to decide how you are going to tackle this. For example, you could skim the readings as a group, stopping where a group member finds an interesting or ambiguous point to discuss.

> As a freelancer you will find that part of your time is going to be spent reading articles very much like the ones you will be reading here.

* Task 1: Read "Getting Started: Grids are Good" to understand what grids are and to gain some appreciation for why they are using in web design.
* Task 2: You know about responsive design so how do we go from a fixed grid like the one discussed above to a fluid/responsive grid that fits our "mobile first" approach. Read "Fluid Grids" to find out!
* Task 3: Now that you know about fluid grids it's time to build a simple fluid grid. "The Building Blocks of a Grid System" points to a great blog post by Chris Coyier of CSS-Tricks. Use this article as a guide for building your fluid grid.
* Task 4: Read "Adding Media Queries to the Mix". Use your fluid grid and media queries to build out your wireframe from earlier.
* Task 5: Reimplement the same wireframe using a responsive grid framework. You can use Bourbon NEAT (http://neat.bourbon.io/), SUSY (http://susy.oddbird.net/) or your favourite framework (whatever it may be).


## In summary

1. Understand the purpose of the website and the target audience.
2. Wireframe the website.
3. Use a grid to code the website
