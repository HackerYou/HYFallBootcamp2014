# Wire-framing and Grids

How do you go about designing a website? Should you start in Photoshop? draw on paper? or maybe code right away?

There are many different ways and programs that can be used to create wireframes but most developers and designers stick of a sharp pencil and graph paper. These to not need to look nice, but simply guide your designs as to where content will go. 

The answer is do what works for you. If you already have a workflow that works for you (especially if you're a graphic designer) then you can stick to it. On the other hand, if you don't have a workflow yet then try the following:

**Step 1.** Think about the goal of the website. Who are the target audience? What content needs to be included? What action do you want the audience to take? What are the important parts? etc.
**Step 2.** Get out a piece of paper and a pen and start drawing rough sketches. The sketches serve as mockups and wireframes for the website. The focus of the wireframe should be on information/content placement while taking into consideration how the users will interact with the content.

Do not think about the design on the site, just the layout of where content will go. It is helpful to make a list of everything that needs to go on site site and start to block off where things will go.
