##UX (User Experience) Design

User experience design is about enabling visitors to effectively and enjoyably use your website. Good UX is informed by many different disciplines - design, psychology, communication - but a lot of it comes down to plain old common sense. You're a user of the web too! Try to keep in mind sites you find easy to use or features that frustrate you as a web user.

###Exercise: What Grinds Your Gears?
Share a bad user experience you've had on a website and discuss how you might fix it.

###Establishing user goals

When crafting your user experience, you need to first think about what you want users to be able to accomplish on your site.

Some goals will be universal. For example,

* users should be able to find their way easily around your site
* content should be easy to digest

Some will be specific to the site you're building. For example,

* *artist website:* users should be able to view the artist's works
* *e-commerce website:* it should be easy for users to browse product selection
* *responsive site:* everything must be touch-friendly

**Once your goals have been established, make your UX decisions based on whether or not those goals will be met.**

**Goal:** easy to digest content
**Good UX:** using clear and concise wording, adjusting paragraph line-height to make text more legible,  use of headings to establish a content hierarchy

**Goal:** browse product selection easily on an e-commerce site
**Good UX:** displaying thumbnails on a product listing page, allowing users to browse variations without leaving the list view:

###Learn from those who came before you

Another good way to come up with killer UI components is to leverage existing **design patterns** on the web. There's a reason most websites have a navigation bar across the top of the screen. It's an established design pattern that allows for easy movement through a website.

In addition to browsing design galleries, have a look at some pattern libraries and tried and tested UI(User Interface) strategies when building your designs.

**A word of caution:** Not everything that's popular is good UI design! Web design can be prone to fads, so always ask yourself if a design pattern is *functional* before implementing it.
