# Wire-framing and Grids

How do you go about designing and planning the structure a website? Should you start in Photoshop? Draw on paper? Code right away?

There are many different ways and many different programs that can be used to create wireframes. But many developers and designers stick to a sharp pencil and graph paper. These sketches do not need to look perfect, they are simply for creating blueprint for your designs. 

Do what works for you. If you already have a workflow that works for you (especially if you're a graphic designer) then you can stick to it. On the other hand, if you don't have a workflow yet then try the following:

**Step 1.** 

Think about the goal of the website. Who is the target audience? What content needs to be included? What action do you want the audience to take? What are the important parts?

**Step 2.** 

Get out some paper and a pen/pencil and start drawing rough sketches. The sketches serve as mockups and wireframes for the website. The focus of the wireframe should be on information & content placement while taking into consideration how the users will interact with the content.

Do not think about the design of the site, just the layout of where content will go. It is helpful to make a list of everything that needs to go on site site as well and start to block off where things will go.
