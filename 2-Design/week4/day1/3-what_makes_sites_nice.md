# What makes websites look nice anyways? 

Often it can be hard to look at a site and realize _why_ you enjoy the design. You may pick out obvious things like colours and fonts used, but its often more than just the very visible choices made. Subtle little edits to your site can take your site from medicore to fantastic looking design.
