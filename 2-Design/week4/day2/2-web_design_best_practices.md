#Web Design Best Practices

While traditional graphic and print design often help inform web design, web design has it's own set of standards and best practices tailored to the online medium.

Here are some general guidelines to follow. 

##Layout

* be generous with whitespace - don't be shy with margins and padding, especially around boxed in elements
* use a grid to easily establish harmony in your designs
* always use a max-width on your containers to prevent content from spilling out too far on big screens
* be consistent with spacing between elements - use a few standard measures or multiples of them

##Colour

* box and text shadows should be subtle - use rgba and/or a darker shade of your background instead of a pure black (#000)
* similarly, avoid the harsh contrast of pure black on white, a nice dark grey (#333) is much easier on the eyes and makes for easy to read text
* try pulling your colour scheme out of a photograph or another website you like. Pictaculous <http://www.pictaculous.com/> is a tool that will do that for you.
* stick to neutrals (blacks, whites, greys) plus one or two accent colours, then work with variations on those (http://0to255.com is great for this!)

##Typography

* always increase the default line-height. 1.5 is a good place to start
* stick to a maximum of one or two fonts - play around with different weights and styles instead of lots of different families
* a common technique is to use one font for headings and another for body copy
* use text-shadow to increase legibility of text over an image
* for big headings, decreased letter spacing looks much better than the default
* for small caps, increased letter spacing looks great
* (Use smart quotes!)[http://practicaltypography.com/straight-and-curly-quotes.html] Designers will LOVE you. 
* make sure your line-length (measure) is appropriate for readability - you want to aim for 50 - 80 characters (including spaces) per line.  Adjust font-size or the element's width to get it right.

##Interactivity

* don't go overboard - use only where appropriate
* subtle CSS transitions on your links and hover effect go a long way
* keep all animation and transition durations short - users donâ€™t like waiting!

###Exercise: Design Critique 

Pick out a few websites that you think look great, then try to dissect *what makes them look great*.  Which best practices have they employed and how? Is there anything you think could be improved upon?

If you don't have an awesome site in mind, check out [The Best Designs](http://www.thebestdesigns.com/) or [Design Fridge](http://www.designfridge.co.uk/).
