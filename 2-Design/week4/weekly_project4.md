title: Week 4 Project - Wireframe and Style Guide

# Week 4 Project
For this week's project, you will be given a client brief of a client who would like a website built.

Before we can get into building the websites, we need to work on our process. For each of these, reference the brief in the <a href="website.docx" class="exercise">**website.docx**</a> file. This will involve two parts:

## Wireframing the website on paper.

Break the website down into sections that need to be integrated into the website. Then, with boxes and rough sketches, wireframe the entire website. Where will all the elements go? Think of a layout that will make sense both for users as well as the goals of the business.


## Creating a style guide

Using the <a href="day2/exercises/style-guide.html" class="exercise">**style-guide.html**</a> collection of HTML elements, create your own `style.css` or `style.scss` file to start building out the basic styles. Without focusing on the layout and design of the website, design how each of the elements on this page will look. Pay special attention to typography, colours, sizes, padding and margin.

##Bonus:

Try converting your sketched wireframe to a living prototype using Foundation.
