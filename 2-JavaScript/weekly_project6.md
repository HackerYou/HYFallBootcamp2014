title: Week 5 Project - jQuery API App
---

# Weekly Project

Your task for this week is to create your very own web app using jQuery and an API. 

We've provided a lits of RESTful APIs that can be accessed publicly and have good documentation. Try to work with an API that has data you find interesting - it'll be way more fun that way! If you're interested in one that's not on the list, come talk to me or one of the mentors and we'll let you know if it's appropriate for this project.

##API choices
* TTC data feed <http://myttc.ca/developers>
* The MovieDB movie and TV info <https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api>
* Disccogs.com music info <http://www.discogs.com/developers/>
* Yummly Recipes <https://developer.yummly.com/>
* Last.FM Artist and Concert Info <http://www.last.fm/api/>
* Dribbble <https://dribbble.com/api/>
* Flickr Photos <https://www.flickr.com/services/api/>
* Wikipedia <http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page/>
* Petfinder <http://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs/>
* Ted Talks <http://developer.ted.com/API_Docs>


## Minimum Requirements

* organize your code using an object app
* access at least two endpoints of your chosen API
* allow a user to interact with your app in some way, eg. a search field or drop-down list that changes results
* Display results in your own custom format
* Your own style/design


##Bonus points for
* accessing more than one API (eg. pull in a flickr photo that's tagged with a weather condition)
* incorporating a jQuery plugin that enhances the UI (eg. isotope, flexslider, custom drop-down menu)
