title: Week 4 Project - Optimize Your Workflow

# Week 4 Project
For this week's project, you will optimize a previous project using Grunt. Implement Grunt into a site and create tasks that will aid in the quick development of your projects.

Once you have implemented a Gruntfile in your project, you will use Github to host the files. Ensure that the project is accessible by everyone with a readme.md file that explains the commands on how to install and use the project.

Use the [http://gruntjs.com/plugins](http://gruntjs.com/plugins) directory to find Grunt plugins that meet your needs and read the documentation for each plugin for the correct way to implement it.

##Technical requirements
* use a Grunt file to automate all your optimization
* implement a watch task so your other tasks run automatically on save
* add this project to github

Implement at least three of the following optimizations with Grunt:
* Set up a local server on your machine.
* smush your images to reduce file size
* minify CSS
* minify JS
* concatenate JS files
* compile your Sass with Grunt
* Autoprefix your CSS with browser prefixes
* Implement LiveReload to refresh your browser when a file changes - Requires Chrome Extension [http://livereload.com/](http://livereload.com/)
