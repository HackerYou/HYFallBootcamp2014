      <h1 id="toolsofthetrade">Tools of the trade</h1>

<p>By now you have probably heard me talk about productivity and proper tools for the job. </p>

<p>When we code, we want to make sure that we are moving as fast as possible. This is even more true when it comes to running the business as these generally aren't billable hours.</p>

<p>With the right tools, you can cut down the amount of time spent on boring tasks such as invoicing as well in increase your professionalism.</p>

<h2 id="anaccountant">An Accountant</h2>

<p>My accountant isn't a tool, but he is a valuable resource that has helped me save thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Seriously this needs to be step #1 for you. Even if tax time is a year away, get hooked up with one. The value of having an accountant obviously comes from them doing all the calculations for you, but the real benefits comes from the advice that they are able to offer you. Whenever I have a question about running my business, I chat with my accountant and I get advice on how to proceed.</p>

<p>My accountant, and most, will be willing to have an hour or two coffee to review your situation. A good accountant will cost around $500-$1,000 a year. Mine was around $750 including all the receipt entry and it was worth every penny.</p>

<p>Do not go to the mall or HR block where they will do your taxes in 2 hours. It's worth spending the money as a good accountant will find more deductions and ultimately get you a bigger return. </p>

<p>If you need a recommendation of a top notch accountant, I highly recommend <a href="http://www.waterfordta.com/">Waterford Tax &amp; Advistor</a>. Tell them I sent you :)</p>

<h2 id="freshbooks">Freshbooks</h2>

<p>If you are using excel to manage your books or even produce invoice, you must stop now and sign up for <a href="https://bostype.Freshbooks.com/refer/www">Freshbooks</a>. </p>

<p>Freshbooks is an online accounting system - the biggest part is used to managing your invoices and expenses. Every time I need to bill someone I pop open Freshbooks and create an invoice in less than 2 minutes. If you are spending more than 2 hours a month on invoicing, you are not spending your time wisely.</p>

<p>If you like to accept payment online, it is integrated into many payment providers. I recommend using Stripe but you are welcome to use paypal or other if you are comfortable with that. For large payments, I tend to disable online payments as 3% fee can add up very quickly. </p>

<p>At tax time, you can quickly export all your data and send it to your accountant. It took me 5 minutes to prep this year.</p>

<p>There is also a mobile app that will let you easily manage your account. This include a nice time tracker if you bill hourly.</p>

<h2 id="wave">Wave</h2>

<p>Wave is an extremely extensive on line accounting/payroll/small business software system. It is definitely much more comprehensive than Freshbooks, but is more targeted at larger businesses. If you plan on having employees, it might be worth taking a look at Wave before you choose Freshbooks.</p>

<h2 id="mint">Mint</h2>

<p>Mint is a website that hooks into all your bank accounts and provides summaries and alerts based on your spending. It's a great tool for keeping track of both personal and business finances. </p>

<p>You will still need to run your own expenses at the end of the year, but this will give you a high level overview of where you money is going.</p>

<h2 id="dropbox">Dropbox</h2>

<p>Dropbox is a cloud sync tool. I only have a single computer so I don't really use the sync that often. I use it more of a backup as I work right out of my dropbox folder on my computer. This means that any time I have an important file, it is automatically backed up to the cloud.</p>

<p>Don't wait until your hard drive crashes to sign up for this, especially if you are keeping receipts and other important business information.</p>

<h2 id="backblaze">BackBlaze</h2>

<p>Similar to dropbox, but for your whole hard drive. Data backup is no joke! </p>

<h2 id="thingsoranytodoapp">Things (or any todo app)</h2>

<p>To-do applications are a dime a dozen and all of them claim to solve all of life's problems. They won't solve all your problems, but can really help your organize tasks that need to happen today and in the next coming days.</p>

<p>As you become a successful freelancer, you will have really busy days that are full of small tasks. Getting them out of your head and into a to-do app (or paper) will free up your mind for coding and greatly reduce any feeling of being overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Which to-do application you use will really depend on your personality and how you work. Some will just use a stack of post-it notes, while others love to categorize </p>

<p>I prefer to use Things for my own personal use as it allows me to create projects. Anytime I need to do something, I just pop it into my application and forget about it until the time comes.</p>

<h2 id="projectmanagement">Project Management</h2>

<p>There will come a time when emailing back and forth with a client turns into a threaded nightmare. Feedback, revisions, bug reports can spiral out of control, especially when more than two stakeholders are involved with a project.</p>

<p>While email can often work for smaller projects, anything larger should use a proper project management system to keep track of everything going on.</p>

<p>Project management software will allow you to create threads for discussion, create lists of items required to be finished, upload screenshots, embed media and many more things. You are also able to create a shared calendar with important project milestones.</p>

<h3 id="basecamp">Basecamp</h3>

<p>Basecamp is one of the most popular project management systems around, we use it at HackerYou to manage both our internal projects as well as a portal for our classes.</p>

<p>It's $20/month and goes up from there. </p>

<p><a href="https://basecamp.com/pricing">https://basecamp.com/pricing</a></p>

<h3 id="trello">Trello</h3>

<p>Trello is a different kind of project management system that works around columns and cards. Each column can be an area or category such as &quot;Done&quot; or &quot;Important&quot; and each card is a threaded conversation that can include text, images and to-do lists.</p>

<p>When the status of a card changes, you can drag and drop it into another column. Cards can be re-ordered based on importance. </p>

<p>I've found that there is a learning curve on how to use Trello properly, especially with clients, but once learned the each Trello board can quickly provide a high level view of where the project is at.</p>

<p>Trello is completely free.</p>

<h3 id="others">Others</h3>

<p>There are dozens of other project management systems. As a freelancer, you will probably find larger clients have their own existing project management software and you will have to learn to use that.</p>

<p>Some others include Asana, Redmine and JIRA.</p>

<h2 id="gmaillabsextensions">Gmail Labs Extensions</h2>

<p>There have been entire books written on email productivity. Gmail labs extensions can make default Gmail fit your work flow a little better. </p>

<p>Here are a few we can talk though:</p>

<p><strong>Auto-advance</strong>
Automatically shows the next conversation instead of your inbox after you delete, archive, or mute a conversation. You can select whether to advance to the next or previous conversation in the &quot;General&quot; Settings page. </p>

<p><strong>Canned Responses</strong>
Email for the truly lazy. Save and then send your common messages using a button next to the compose form. Also automatically send emails using filters. </p>

<p><strong>Undo Send</strong>
Oops, hit &quot;Send&quot; too soon? Stop messages from being sent for a few seconds after hitting the send button. </p>

<p><strong>Send and Archive</strong></p>

<p>Send a reply, automatically archive the message until it is responded to. Helps to keep a clean inbox.</p>

<h2 id="grasshopper">Grasshopper</h2>

<p>Grasshopper is a service that reproduces the functionality of expensive PBX phone systems used in large companies.</p>

<p>For $12 a month, you can get a 1-800 number and assign extensions to everyone in your company which will then ring their regular landline or cellphone.</p>

<p>This increase the professionalism of your company as well as cut down on expensive phone bills for your clients.</p>

<h2 id="skypeout">Skype Out</h2>

<p>In Canada we aren't lucky enough to be able to have Skype In numbers which assigns a number to your skype account. You can, however, get something call Skype out that allows you to call anyone from skype while the caller ID still shows up as your normal phone number. I have an unlimited plan within North America and it costs me $3/month. </p>

<h2 id="microsoftlx-3000">Microsoft LX-3000</h2>

<p>These are good quality and comfortable USB headphones with a good microphone. Great for taking phone calls while having your hands free to type. Also really good for getting in the zone with music.</p>

<p>There are many headsets like these. I've found these to be the best for your money. Usually running around $25-35 a pair. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/lifechat-lx-3000">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/lifechat-lx-3000</a></p>

<h2 id="signdocumentswithadobereader">Sign Documents with Adobe Reader</h2>

<p>Chances are you will be signing a lot of contracts and Non-disclosure agreements. It's 2014 and I still have people tell me where I can fax documents. What a joke! </p>

<p>I used to print contract, sign them, scan them in, and them somehow cobble them back together into a single PDF. Here is how I handle signing contracts now.</p>

<ol>
<li>Sign a piece of paper and scan it in, or take a photo with a good camera.</li>
<li>Bring that into photoshop a separate it into a a layered signature. This usually involves playing with the brightness/contrast.</li>
<li>Save as a transparent PNG file.</li>
<li>Download and install Adobe Reader</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, when you open PDF files with Adobe Reader, you have the option to sign documents. Simply import your signature and continue signing away. </p>

<h2 id="faxingwithellofax.">Faxing wit HelloFax.</h2>

<p>Once in a blue moon you will actually have to fax something. I have about 4 times in my career. </p>

<p>HelloFax lets you send faxes by scanning them in or taking a picture. No need for a fax machine or running to Kinkos. </p>

<h1 id="screencastupdates">Screencast Updates</h1>

<p>I've talked about doing a screencast for your clients. To reiterate: Use a screenrecording software to record your screen and run them through how to use every part of their new website. This cuts back on emails back and forth on how to use the system as well as when a new person is hired at the client company. </p>

<p>I use ScreenFlow, which is $100. Well worth the money when compared to time saved.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telestream.net/Screenflow/">http://www.telestream.net/Screenflow/</a></p>

<p>For shorter clips, you can use free, web-based software screenr. It is based on Java and can be difficult to get up and running.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.screenr.com/">http://www.screenr.com/</a></p>

<p>Another option is to &quot;broadcast&quot; a public google hangout which can then be pushed to youtube. This doesn't provide any editing tools. </p>
