# Weekly Project

Your task for the weekly project is to create your very own movie app. Use the movie app that we built together as a guide.

## Minimum Requirements

* A custom style/design.
* A list of Movies or TV shows of your choice.
* The ability to rate the movies/shows using a real user session (we used a guest session in our tutorial).
* Use at least one of the other API categories that we haven't worked with yet (e.g. collections, people, credits, lists, genres, search, reviews, etc.).
* Have fun!
