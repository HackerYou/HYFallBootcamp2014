- functions as first class objects very confusing. Be more explicit about:

## two ways to define function
`function myFunction(){}`
or
`var myFunction = function(){}`

Talk about differences? Too abstract at the moment.

## reference function
`myFunction`
we get back an object.

## call function
`myFunction()`
call it with `()` and we get back the result of the function


Functions as first-class objects too abstract without seeing it in action in jQuery. Move this section to jQuery. Move `this` too to jQuery, discuss it when appropriate. Move the "how to solve problems" exercise up to replace this material.


## Drawing diagrams helps

* the input/values => black box => output/values diagram explains a lot.
* visualizing arrays as references helps too [0-> "hello", 1-> 25]
* visualize DOM objects as just plain old `{}` objects. Make a parallel between this and changing a regular object.

## Misc:

* more "real world" exercises/examples
