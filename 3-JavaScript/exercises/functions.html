      // 1. The following function isn't printing anything to the console. Can you spot the syntax error? Be sure to check your console for errors.

      function iLoveCoffee{
        console.log("Coffee is delicious.");
      }
      iLoveCoffee();


      // 2. The following function isn't printing anything to the console.  What did we forget?

      function iLovePizza(){
        console.log("Pizza is my favourite food!");
      }

      // 3. Write a function `myInfo()` that logs both your name and email to the console.

      // 4. Change this `iReallyLovePizza` function to accept a single `topping` argument, then log the argument to the console.

      function iReallyLovePizza(){
        console.log("I love pizza!");
        console.log("And my favourite topping is...");
        //log your favourite topping to the console here
      }

      // 5. Write a function with one parameter, `whatsForDinner(meal)`, which alerts the name of the meal passed to it. Call your function three times with a different meal argument each time.


      // 6. Write a function `multiply(n1, n2)` that returns the value of n1 and n2 multiplied together. *Hint:* We use the `*` character to denote multiplication in JavaScript. Make sure you test to see that your function does what you expect.


      // 7. Write a function `greaterThanThree(n)` which logs "Yes" to the console if a n is greater than three. *Hint:* You will need to use the `>` comparrison operator and a conditional statement inside your function.

      // 8. Write a function `maxOfTwo(n1,n2)` which returns the higher of two numeric values.

      // 9. Write a function `maxOfThree(n1,n2,n3)` which returns the highest of three numeric values.

      // BONUS: Write a function `charIsVowel(c)` that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) as argument and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise. E.g. `charIsVowel("b")` returns `false`.

      //DOUBLE BONUS: Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to n (n being an argument). But for multiples of 3 print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiple of both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”.

      // Hint: You might need to use something from the control flow lesson.
