# Stripe checkout Code-along

Stripe is a payment processor that also has a front-end library called `stripe.js`. This will allow you to sell things and accept credit cards right on your website.

This is ideal for when you are selling a single item and don't need the overhead of an entire shopping system that includes carts, sizes and whatnot.

Before we get started, make sure you sign up for stripe: <http://stripe.com>
