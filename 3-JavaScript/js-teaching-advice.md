# JavaScript Teaching Advice

The following advice comes from two tutoring sessions that I did with students. We went over the JavaScript material and they gave me some really good feedback. Here are a few things that might help you teach this topic better.


## Exercises

* students like doing exercises together as a class and then getting the opportunity to do an exercise on their own
* give a summary/recap of the material that students need to understand in order to do an exercise before they tackle it.

## General things

* avoid talking about things people haven't learned yet. Everything should be taught in familiar context.
* remind students that it helps to declare variables at the top (and they can comma separate them)
* students struggle with syntax: common errors include `functionName ()`, a space is placed between the name and the parenthesis.
* formatting if/else statements and placing the brackets in the right place (stylistically) is difficult.
* students don't know that variable names should be meaningful
* there is sometimes confusion about variables vs. "strings". Students might ask when "do we put quotation marks and when do we not?".
* students like seeing the instructor find an answer to a problem by searching Google. It shows that they don't have to know everything.
* translating a problem written in a natural language (english) to computer language is tough. students don't know where to start.

## Drawing

Programming can be tough to teach so I had a lot of success by drawing things out. If you have access to a whiteboard then use it. Drawing things while explaining a concept can help a lot. 

The diagrams don't have to be great, you just need to get the point across.
