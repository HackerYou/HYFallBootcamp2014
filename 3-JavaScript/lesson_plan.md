# Lesson Plan

The JavaScript weeks are heavy with content. Programming is likely to be very new for everyone so "exploration" will be kept to a minimum. Students will be taught in a very traditional way this week: "lecture" and "drill" with exercises and projects. There are a few opportunities later in the week where students can work in pairs but even that has guided tutorials.

## JavaScript Teaching Advice

The following advice comes from two tutoring sessions that I did with students. We went over the JavaScript material and they gave me some really good feedback. Here are a few things that might help you teach this topic better.


### Exercises

* Students like doing exercises together as a class and then getting the opportunity to do an exercise on their own.
* Give a summary/recap of the material that students need to understand in order to do an exercise before they tackle it.

### General advice

* Avoid talking about things people haven't learned yet. Everything should be taught in familiar context.
* Remind students that it helps to declare variables at the top of a function (and they can comma separate them).
* Students struggle with syntax: common errors include `functionName ()`, a space is placed between the name and the parenthesis.
* Formatting if/else statements and placing the brackets in the right place (stylistically) is difficult so suggest that they put the skeleton for the conditional in first before writing any other code.
* Point out that variable names should be meaningful.
* There is sometimes confusion about variables vs. "strings". Students might ask "when do we put quotation marks and when do we not?".
* Students like seeing the instructor find an answer to a problem by searching Google. It shows that students don't have to know everything.
* Translating a problem written in a natural language (english) to computer language is tough; they don't know where to start.

### Drawing

Programming is very abstract so it can be tough to teach so I had a lot of success by drawing things out. If you have access to a whiteboard then use it. Drawing things while explaining a concept can help a lot. The diagrams don't have to be great, you just need to get the point across.
