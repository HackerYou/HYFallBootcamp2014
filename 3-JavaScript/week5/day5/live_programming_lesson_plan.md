# Week 5, Day 5: jQuery Plugins Lesson Plan

During this lesson the instructor will code live to demonstrate how they would go about solving an issue/task.

**The task**: the UI that the instructor is working on consists of a grid of boxes. The position of the boxes matter, users need to be able to sort these boxes.

- Start by asking students: "What would we use to accomplish this task? css? Javascript? with jQuery?" Solution: JavaScript and jQuery.
- Take a moment to discuss what is required to code such a feature from scratch. For example: we would need to keep track of the positions of the boxes, build drag/drop functionality, etc.
- Search the internet for a jQuery plugin that would do the job. What search terms would you use? What websites would you search? Solution: combination of "drag and drop", "jQuery plugin", "grid sort", "drag and sort". Possible directory: unheap.com.
- There are many solutions, which one should we go with? What should we consider? Solution: check Github (last commit more recent for Gridster), any major projects using Gridster? ("Dashing" uses Gridster), number of features? (Gridster has many more features - both a pro and con)
- Use http://gridster.net/ for this demo
- Read the documentation together and look at the demos
- Build the markup
- Load jQuery and Gridster.js
- Add the literally three lines of code that is required to make this work.

**2nd Task**: Do students have a suggestion? Is there a functionality that they want to implement? Follow the same process again, except of course this time without prepared material.

Possible plugins to explore:

- Fittext
- jQuery-modal
- unslider
- jQuery EastTabs
