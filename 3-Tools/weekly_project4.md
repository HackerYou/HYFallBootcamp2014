# Weekly Project: jQuery Plugin with Documentation

As with this other tools in this industry, open-source development is a great asset not only in your resume, but adds to your qualifications and appearance as a member of the development community.

Once the plugin has been created, create a Github repository to host the plugin, and create a Github Page that will contain documentation for a user to utilize your tool. As well, include some example HTML files of the plugin running.

Be sure to include default options and allow the user to input their own values to modify the plugin to their own needs.
