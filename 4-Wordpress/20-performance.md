# Performance 

How fast your website loads is very important. Slow website means a higher bounce rate; users will leave out of frustration. To speed up your website:

* minify/compress CSS & JavaScript
* Use a CDN to server your assets
* Deactivate and delete any unnecessary plugins.
* optimize images by running them through Smush.it

Plugin:

Also at some point you need to consider upgrading your web-host to get more RAM, storage, etc. 

## Uptime

Your website (or your clients') websites might go down without you knowing. Use uptime monitoring tools to get an email whenever your website goes down. Why?

* get notified immediately so you can fix the issue
* collect uptime data to help you decide whether to stay with your host or not
