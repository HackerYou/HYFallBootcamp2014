You will then see these options:

* Search - search for specific plugins or by tag name
* Upload - upload a zipped plugin file.
* Featured - filter search by featured plugins
* Popular - filter search by popular plugins
* Newest - filter search by newest plugins
* Favorites - If you have marked plugins as favorites on [wordpress.org/plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/), you can browse them here.

Only free plugins that follow all WordPress guidelines are in this directory.

Once you find the plugin that you want, select **Install Now**, then **Activate Plugin** when the install is complete. You can also deactivate and delete plugins from this panel.

##Install plugins via FTP

Plugins can also be installed by uploading it to the server directly into your Wordpress plugin folder.  It must be unzipped before it's uploaded. You can find the folder under **wp-content > plugins**.

You can also remove plugins by deleting them from the server.
