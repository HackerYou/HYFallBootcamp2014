# Wordpress Troubleshooting

You will probably run into many issues when using Wordpress. Troubleshooting is a very important skill for a freelancer.

## Source of the problem

The first step is to understand the source of the problem. Is it an HTML problem? CSS? JavaScript? Wordpress? Maybe it's a Wordpress plugin?

If you take an HTML problem to the Wordpress forums then people are less likely to help you. If you search a JavaScript error in the Wordpress Codex then your chances of finding a solution are minimal.

## Understand the Lingo

Each technology has a big community surrounding it and chances are they have their own lingo. If you have a JavaScript problem then use the vocabulary that you learned to describe your problem.

Wordpress has its own set of [semantics and terminology](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Semantics). Describe your problem using this lingo.

## Search for a solution

Once you understand the source of the problem and can describe it, you are likely to find a solution by doing a search in Google and/or Stack-overflow. If you have an error message then copy/paste the error into Google. If the error is more subtle then use a few relevant words to describe the problem. 

The Wordpress documentation/codex is super helpful; almost everything is there. Common problems can be seen [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Troubleshooting). The Wordpress forums are extremely useful if you can't find a solution to your problem in the codex.

The key idea is to search and read carefully. Most of the problems that you will run into have already been resolved.

## Ask for help

If you can't find a solution anywhere then you should feel comfortable asking someone for help. The Stack-overflow community can help you resolve the issue relatively quickly as long as you describe your problem very well. The Wordpress support forums are also a great place to ask questions. 

The Stack-overflow website has [a great piece about how to ask a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask). Notice that they start by telling you to thoroughly search for an answer. Before asking a question on the Wordpress forums make sure you read the [Welcome Message](http://codex.wordpress.org/Forum_Welcome). Notice again that the start with "Search First". 

Don't be discouraged from asking a question, just make sure that you've done your research first!
