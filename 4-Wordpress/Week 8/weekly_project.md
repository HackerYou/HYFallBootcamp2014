# Weekly Project

Your goal for this week is to transform your personal Wordpress website into a proper portfolio by using custom post types. By the end of the week you should have both the front-end and back-end set up so that showing your work becomes much easier.

* From the admin panel you should be able to add "works" to your portfolio without having to touch your code. The interface should allow you to add attributes like title, description, and image for each of the works.
* The front end should display the portfolio pieces. This is an opportunity to get creative and to use all of the design, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery knowledge that you have acquired so far.
* Example portfolio type Wordpress websites can be seen here: http://themify.me/themes#portfolio-theme

Remember that demo day is next week so try to combine your knowledge and experience of CSS, HTML, JavaScript and jQuery to come up with something impressive.
