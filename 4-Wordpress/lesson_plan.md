# Lesson Plan - Wordpress

The Wordpress section relies heavily on the Wordpress Codex - the focus is on providing students with links to the appropriate place in the codex and prompting them with a question or activity to start their exploration. At this point in the course (7-8 weeks in) students are likely to respond better to less "content/lectures" and more activities that let them explore and build unique work to add to their portfolio.

The "client challenges" document offers students with many authentic challenges. The client requests are ill-defined on purpose to give students more realistic scenarios. Students should ideally work in groups to tackle the challenges and get feedback from their peers and instructors. You can make this document available and let students decide which challenges they want to tackle. Alternatively you can present a challenge or two to students every day.

The "topics_to_explore" document offers a few suggestions for how students can use their time if they don't know what to do. Wordpress is a huge ecosystem so no student should be sitting there doing nothing when there is so much to explore!

## Extra presentations this week

Depending on how things are going you can ask students to work in groups to find something exciting in the Wordpress ecosystem to share with the class. Students would introduce what they found, why it's useful, why it excites them, etc.

Students are presenting "lightning talks" throughout the course so this is an additional opportunity to speak.
