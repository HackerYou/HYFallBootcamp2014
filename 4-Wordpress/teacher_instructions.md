# Teacher Instructions - Wordpress

The Wordpress section relies heavily on the Wordpress Codex - the focus is on providing students with links to the appropriate place in the codex and prompting them with a question or activity to start their exploration. At this point in the course (7-8 weeks in) students will respond better to less "content" and more activities that let them explore and build unique work to add to their portfolio.


The "client challenges" document offers students with many authentic challenges. The client requests are ill-defined on purpose to give students more realistic scenarios. Students should ideally work in groups to tackle the challenges and get feedback from their peers and instructors.
