# Topics to Explore

If you have time this week then why not explore some of the following topics:

* Combining jQuery plugins and Wordpress custom post types to for example create a slider or image gallery with an interface to manage images.
* Wordpress Frameworks like Genesis(studiopress.com) and Pods(pods.io).
* More Wordpress Plugins (e.g. Jetpack, WordPress SEO by Yoast)
* Wordpress hosting for freelancers like http://getflywheel.com/


**Exercise this week:**
This week involves a lot of exploration. The Wordpress ecosystem is huge. Work in groups to find something exciting and share it with the class!

The objective is to create a "lightning talk", which is a very quick (~5 min) presentation. Quickly introduce what you found, why it's useful, why it excites you, etc.
