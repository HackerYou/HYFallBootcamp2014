# Weekly Project

This week you will take an existing HTML & CSS site and turn it into a **responsive** Wordpress theme. We recommend doing this for the personal blog/portfolio website that you built earlier.

Your theme should have at least the following:

* one registered navigation
* one widget area
* theme files: index.php, single.php, page.php, sidebar.php, header.php & footer.php, and style.css

Make sure that you test your theme. Upload your content to a local Wordpress installation and activate the theme.

* Check that all of the content displays properly.
* Follow the [Guidelines: Theme Check](http://make.wordpress.org/themes/guidelines/guidelines-theme-check/)
* Fix any PHP or Wordpress errors.
* Fix any JavaScript errors.
* Test in all your target web browsers.
