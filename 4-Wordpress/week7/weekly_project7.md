title: Week 7 Project - Custom WordPress Theme

# Weekly Project

This week you will build your own custom WordPress theme. 

This would be a great opportunity to take on a small client site! You could also do an unsolicited re-do for an existing site that's outdated, like a local restaurant or business.

You can start from scratch or use a starter theme. Building from scratch can be more work to get started, but you'll have the pleasure of only working with you own code. Using a starter theme helps you get going a lot faster, but you'll have to work with a lot of code you didn't wite yourself. Choose whichever method you think works best with your coding style.

If you do choose to use a starter theme, we recommend these ones:

* the HackerYou starter theme provided in your notes
* [Bones](http://themble.com/bones/)
* [Underscores](http://underscores.me/)

You site should have the following:

* at least three pages (eg. Home, About and Blog)
* one page *must* be a blog or news page
* one registered navigation
* one widget area
* minimum theme files: index.php, single.php, page.php, sidebar.php, header.php & footer.php, and style.css
* site should be responsive
