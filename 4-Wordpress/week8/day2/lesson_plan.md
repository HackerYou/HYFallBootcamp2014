# Lesson Plan

At this point students are almost one week away from demo day so this day is for them. Students should work on their weekly projects or on something unique to show on demo day.

Everyone should have something to demo so try your best to make this happen. This means checking in with everyone to make sure they have something to demo. If they don't then help them out.

While students are working the instructors should go around and give feedback about the weekly project from the previous week (week 7).
