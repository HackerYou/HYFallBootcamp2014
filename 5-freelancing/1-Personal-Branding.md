# So You Want a New Career

Whether you want to land a job as a front-end developer or start a freelance business, there's a lot you need to know. HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design, JavaScript, jQuery and Wordpress are just the technical skills you need, and that's what Brenna, Drew, Sacha and Kristen will spend the next eight weeks teaching you.

But there's more that you need to do. You need to show people that you're ready for whatever challenges they want to throw at you despite your lack of experience. We need to show them that your skills and enthusiasm are enough (which is true). The way we'll do that is through having each of you develop a strong personal brand.

# Personal Branding 
How others perceive you and your skills is one of the most important parts of being a professional today, no matter what industry you're in. While capability and coding skill matter a lot, your personal brand is just as important in terms of helping you to get where you want to go. If you're going to be going into business for yourself as a freelancer or independent web developer, personal brand matters even more. Your reputation is what will help you - or hinder you - in landing clients and growing your business.

##Here are some tips for building your personal brand:

## Personal Branding Skeeze

The personal branding space carries around skeeze. Much of the personal branding world revolves around tips, tricks and gimmicks on how to stand out, and how to model yourself after Apple Computers. The space is often littered with stock images such as:

Personal branding isn't about business cards or a gimmicky fedora that you always wear. It's about creating a **rock solid and well-rounded perception*** of yourself, your skills, your work ethic and your business.

We're happy to chat with you one on one about your personal brands throughout the course, but here are some high level aspects to think about. 

## Fake it 'till you make it
As a web developer, you want to be *perceived* as being the best in x, y or z. It can take time to get there. For example, of course you want to be the best WordPress developer out there, but when you are just starting out, you just won't be the best. 

There is always going to be someone who is better at WordPress than you are. The key to getting a job offer or landing gigs is to have others perceive you as someone who would be a good fit for their particular job/gig. You want your name or company to be synonymous with the sort of projects you want to work on. 

In Wes's case, he worked really hard create a personal brand so that people associated him with web development, more specifically WordPress, and later on JavaScript and HTML5. Eventually, whenever someone mentioned they needed someone to work on WordPress, Wes was the first person that would come to mind. And still is.

When you're starting out, you might choose a more manageable specialization. You could become the BEST at forms, not just making them look nice but also acting as a "motion designer" and creating amazing interactions that delight your users. Or you might choose to specialise in a certain area, like Rasion (Spring 2014 cohort) who has decided to focus on fashion. Many of his projects are fashion-related, which helped him land an interview at Holt Renfrew.

What are people going to know you for at the end of your nine weeks with us? Choose it now. Then, once you're working, expand that specialization, slowing growing your areas of expertise until you're as well-known for something as Wes is.

## Pick a name

For freelancers:

One question we get asked fairly often is whether to run your personal brand and company under your own name, under a company name or a mix of the two. All three of these are all fantastic and the decision ultimately comes down to how you see your personal brand unfolding in the future. 

### Wes's personal brand 
When Wes first got started, he spent hours and hours thinking of company names that might work well for him. He ran them past friends until someone asked him:

**"Why would you use a company name? You are _Wes Bos_"**. 

Right then it hit him, he had years of _"Wes Bos, that website guy"_ behind him and it would be a shame to throw it away. Wes is also lucky to have a fairly short, snappy and memorable name. 

A few years later Wes transitioned his freelancing business into a full blown company (albeit just his wife and him), named BosType Inc. Even though they do business under the name **BosType** (e.g. people write cheques to BosType, Inc.), Wes still puts most of his effort into into his "Wes Bos" personal brand.

The reasoning behind this is that Wes knew he wasn't getting into the web development word to grow a huge company, but rather to work for himself. He wants clients to pay him top dollar for his own expertise rather than a company that is good at xyz. He also doesn't have plans to hire other people, pay for an office space, etc.

### Examples
Lea Verou <http://lea.verou.me/> — Speaker, Writer, Developer, Designer 

Seth Godin <http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/> — Author, Speaker, Bald

Heather Payne <http://heatherpayne.ca/> — Ladies Learning Code, HackerYou, Investor, Speaker

Wes Bos <http://wesbos.com/> - Freelance Web Developer & Designer, Teacher

### Running under a company name
The above won't be the case for everyone. You may have your goals set on eventually (or immediately) creating a team and blooming into an agency.

Running under a company name isn't always as _personal_ but it certainly can give the impression that your company is larger and more professional than you may actually be. This may allow you to bid on larger projects and have companies take you more seriously. It also affords you the ability to easily grow the company should you choose too in the future. 

### Examples

Frank and Vivian are Studio Function <http://studiofunction.com/>

Nascent <http://nascentdigital.com/>

Happy Cog <http://happycog.com//>

### A mix of both
You may not have a very unique name, so it might not be available on twitter/domains nor google-able.

You may choose to run under an alias or a handle which you have just made up.

Chis Coyier is **CSS Tricks** <http://css-tricks.com/> — Blogger, developer, CSS-master

Kathy Sierra is **Serious Pony** <http://seriouspony.com/> — Author, Teacher

Mike Taylor is **MikeTaylr** <https://miketaylr.com/> — Mozilla Web Advocate 

Carmen Rose is **Love Carmen Rose** <http://lovecarmenrose.com/>

Jessica Duarte (Winter 2014 grad) is **Jess, Please** <http://jessplease.com/> - Front-End Developer & Freelancer

If you're pursuing a full-time job, this is still important. Your name is your brand, and you need to put time and energy into making it something people remember. You may be able to charge a premium (e.g. go from a salary of $50K to a salary of $60K) just by bringing a strong personal brand to the table. Or, you can make money on the side through speaking gigs, like Darcy Clarke does.

## Creating and investing in a personal brand
Creating a personal brand is extremely valuable and you need to make sure you devote time to creating and maintaining your personal brand. Whether you work full-time or freelance, there will _always_ be work to do and emails to send, so make sure to block time to develop your personal brand. You can gey yourself on track by ensuring you tweet regularly, blog at least a few times, and develop your own personal projects during your nine weeks at HackerYou. 

So, _how_ do you do these things?

### Be Loud, vocal, have opinions and share them

The biggest part of creating your own personal brand is being extremely vocal about what you do. **You must let everyone know what is it that you do.**

Being a developer isn't just a job, it's going to be a huge part of your life and you need to make it seem so to others around you. To do this, you must get really involved both within the development community as well as outside of it. 

Many people don't like to talk about themselves or the work they are doing as it can feel braggy. There is a fine line between being obnoxious and keeping people up to date with what you are doing. This is something we all have to learn, and you'll get there eventually...with practice! 

We will go into _how_ you can be vocal in the coming sections. 

### Be Reliable 
Especially for freelancers, there are going to be times in your career where you will drop the ball, where you won't be able to finish a project on time or where you just need drop a project completely. If you're working full-time, you'll also have to balance various things: your job, extra-curriculars, volunteer opportunities, commitments to friends or partners, etc. There will be times when you're stretched too thin.

These things are going to happen and there is no getting around it. How you handle these situations is very important to your reputation and your personal brand.

Tips on being reliable:

1. Respond to initial inquiry or other important emails as soon as you can. (As an employee, replying to your boss late at night can go a long way in showing your commitment to your job!)
2. Honour your verbal and written committments.
3. No matter how much you hate it, always pick up the phone.
4. If you foresee any issues in project timing, let your client know as soon as possible. A client always prefers transparency over hiding possible problems.
5. If you screw something up, explain the problem along with a solution and time line to get it fixed. 
6. Under promise, over deliver.

It is especially important to be a reliable and consistent person when you are freelancing because so many of our leads come from referrals. 

You may stumble upon a contact who can refer a few people a month to you. I do this for Wes, and now I do it for bootcamp grads who have started freelancing. By referring you, they are sticking their neck out for you, saying you are the right person for the job. If you flake out, that will get back to them and you have burned a very valuable bridge. 

### Fresh
A personal brand isn't something you develop in a few days and then ride out. It's something that you need to be continually working on. At first it may seem like work, but it will soon become second nature as you immerse yourself in this industry.

Whether its tweaking your site design, updating business cards, writing a blog post, tweeting or applying to speak at a conference, you should always be building on your brand.

During your time at HackerYou, I suggest that you try and tweet three times per day. I also recommend creating something extra (outside of the assigned course material) every single week. This can be a blog post (try and do at least three during the bootcamp), a Codepen, a mini (or major) project, or anything else.

### Facebook
Facebook seems like the last place you would go to get work. It seems like a very personal and private space for family and friends, not really a space where many converse with industry people.

However, Facebook is an awesome tool for building your personal brand. Facebook is a gold mine of people who already trust you and would love to recommend you, if they just knew what you did. 

So, I'm not saying to create a facebook page and spam everyone in your list, but rather share links to websites you are building, share pictures of your Hackeryou experience, tell everyone you build websites and are available for work.

For example, Wes often gets messages from people on facebook saying something like this:

> Hey Wes, hows it going? Long time no talk! Anyways, I see that you are always doing website stuff and I was wondering if you were interested in doing something for my (dad's|uncle's|sister's|friend's brother in law) company.

Even if you haven't talked to people on Facebook in years, they still see what you are doing. The moment someone asks for a web developer, you will instantly come to their mind. 

#### Filtering

But...Facebook is for true friends! I delete people all the time!

Never delete anyone from facebook! They are extremely valuable for referrals. Instead, create sharing profiles with limited access. Don't want that creep from highschool to see your baby pictures? No problem at all, just create a filter where he can only see publicly posted items. Ask us if you need help with this.

### Have a tweet-length, a short, and a long bio
One of the hardest things to do is to write about yourself. Every developer needs to have a bio written about themselves and have it handy for when the need arises. 

What often happens is you will be featured in some sort of fashion that requires a bio. Whether it be a LLC mentor spotlight, a blog post or in a speakers lineup for a conference. These are always needed ASAP and are often rushed out the door.

You should have a ready-to-go bios that are tweet-length (for your website homepage, Twitter bio and short intros), a one-paragraph bio (for the quick intro on a blog post), and a longer one for your own website.

Writing a bio is hard, I usually start by writing down what I want to get across by answering the following questions:

1. Who am I?
2. What do I do? What's my speciality?
3. What/who do I work with?
4. What am I passionate about?
5. Where can you find me?
6. A call to action to get in touch

If you have a friend who is good with words, buy them a beer in trade for a little copy writing. 

#### Examples

Twitter-length:

Some thoughts for your Twitter-length bio:
- say clearly what you do
- attach yourself to some organizations using that organization's handle
- include something that showcases your personality

@vivianhui:

> Toronto web / interaction / mobile / print graphic designer. Founding Partner of @studiofunction. Likes: the future. Dislikes: olden times.

@proudfeet

> Web developer @demacmedia • Serial learner • Snack enthusiast • UX Advocate • @thisishackeryou Alum

Longer bio:

@heatherpayne

Heather Payne is the CEO of HackerYou, Canada's original programming bootcamp and to date, the only one of dozens around North America that was founded by women. HackerYou offers Toronto's best full- and part-time courses for people who want to learn to code. You can learn more about HackerYou's bootcamp graduates here. Heather also operates a 7000-square foot digital literacy education facility in the heart of downtown Toronto called The Lab.

In 2011, Heather founded Ladies Learning Code, a Canadian not-for-profit organization that runs popular workshops for women (and men, and girls and boys) who want to learn computer programming and other technical skills in a social and collaborative way. Ladies Learning Code now has chapters in 19 cities across Canada and thriving programs for youth. In 2012, Heather spent a year working on a project for the Mozilla Foundation: her job was to build a community of people and organizations in Toronto who care about raising youth as creators - not just consumers - of technology and the web. The project was granted $365,000 in funding from the Ontario Trillium Foundation. Heather was the first investor in ShopLocket (acquired in 2014 by PCH International), and was recently named one of Canada's Top 100 Most Powerful Women in the Trendsetters & Trailblazers category, as well as one of the Globe and Mail's Top 12 Canadian "Innovators at Work".

### Avatars & Print pictures

Ditch the picture of your cat and get a real, high quality photo of yourself taken. (We're taking care of this for you!) Having a consistent avatar that shows your face makes people feel at ease when dealing with you. They know you are a real person. 

Have large, high resolution version of your photo available for anyone who asks. When you are featured on a website or in print, the last thing you want is someone pulling a photo from four years ago that they found on Google images. 

Take care of your visual identity and always keep it up to date. Consider using the same profile photo on all sites that impact your personal brand: Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.

Eventually, you might want to set up a page like this: <http://heatherpayne.ca/official-bio>

### Blog
You have probably already been told this a million times, but having a blog is _so_ crucial to the success of a freelancer or front-end developer. You're trying to break in to a new industry, and it's going to take some extra work. By sharing what you know — be it about technology, business, or life — you will start to be perceived as an expert in that area.

I know, blogging is hard. That's why no one does it. That's why blogging is going to make you stand out.

Wes often shares short tutorials or examples of code that he found helpful on his blog. These are not only helpful to other developers, but clients can see that you really know your stuff. A bunch of students in the last cohort did a great job blogging throughout their time here. Here are some examples:

Amy Allen (now a front-end developer at Demac Media): http://amyallen.ca/blog/
Gab White (returning to her job in Halifax as a front-end developer, not just a designer): http://gabwhite.com/
Emily Porta (now a front-end developer at ShiftHealth): http://emilyporta.com/blog

### Make Share-able Stuff

If you don't like blogging, another great option is to show off your skills by creating things that people will want to share. It's a great way to show off your expertise and build your personal brand, without having to (groan) write.

During her time at HackerYou, Winter 2014 Bootcamp grad Gab White made an app that tells you the weather. But it doesn't just tell you the weather. It tells you if you're going to have a bad hair day or not. Check it out here: <http://gabwhite.com/weather/>

Someone picked it up, and her app ended up being featured in [Yahoo Tech] (https://www.yahoo.com/tech/finally-an-app-that-tells-women-how-the-weather-will-82309720957.html), [Huffington Post] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/11/hair-weather-app_n_5128777.html) and [Cosmopolitan UK] (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2604343/Rain-showers-dont-bother-straightening-hair-New-app-reveals-weather-affect-curls-frizz-stylish-do.html).

### Twitter
Tell people what do you in your twitter bio, air on the side of bragging. Look important. This will show people that you are really involved and interesting to follow.

> Designer ❯ Developer ❯ JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, PHP and WordPress ❯ Lead instructor at #hackeryou #ladieslearningcode ❯ Sublime Text fan ❯ ♥ @KaitBos

Finally, here are some other Twitter best practices:

* Incorporate your brand
* Use a professional photo
* Include variety in your tweets
* Watch your following/follower ratio

##LinkedIn

You have to have a LinkedIn profile. It's one of the first places potential employers or potential clients will look when they're determining if you might be a fit for them. Here are some tips for making your profile perfect:

- Make your headline "Front-End Developer"
- Add either freelancing or HackerYou as your most recent experience.
- Include a summary. This can be the same longer bio that you're using on your website about page.
- List your skills. Here's a list of skills you'll have by the end of your nine weeks at HackerYou (just add them now):
	* HTML5, CSS3 and responsive design
	* Precompiled syntaxes such as Jade and Sass
	* JavaScript fundamentals, jQuery and using APIs
	*Workflow automation and Javascript tooling with Grunt
	*WordPress theme development (including converting HTML & CSS sites to WordPress themes, using custom post types and custom fields, etc.)
	* Version control and open-sourcing code using Git and Github
	* Paired programming & working in teams
	* Sublime Text
	* Best practices for modern web development
	* Website accessibility requirements
- Include a few bullet points about all of the jobs you're listing. If any of your previous jobs related to tech/digital at all, emphasize those points.
- Have your peers upvote your skills.
- Get some recommendations from former employers.

### Email Address
Having a professional email address on your own domain will really up the level of your credibility. Ditch SoccerGurl88@hotmail.com and sign up for a real email provider. 

We recommend using Google Apps as it is exactly like Gmail. This will allow you to create an email address @yourdomain.com. You can also create alias to other domain names.

Wes have one google apps account setup for wesbos.com, kaitbos.com and bostype.com.

<http://www.google.ca/enterprise/apps/business/>

It is no longer free, but well worth the $50/year per user. 

<http://www.google.ca/enterprise/apps/business/pricing.html>

Back in early 2014, Christopher also found a way to set up a personal email address for free through Bluehost, so you can ask him about it.

You should also set up an email footer, with your full name, title (Front-End Developer), phone number, and links to your personal site, Twitter profile and Github profile. Make it easy for someone you're emailing to learn more about you!

### Speak at conferences 

This is a scary thing to do. Wes always tells people that the first time someone asked him to speak, it was at a small meetup of about 100 people and he was terrified. He thought I didn't know enough to be a speaker. 

Once you speak and attend enough conferences, you will learn that each person is just sharing what they know about a certain area.

Take some time to really learn a certain topic — for example, CSS3 Animations and Transitions — and put together a 25 min talk. You can then submit this to conferences and local meetups and possibly go deliver it. 

Being a "speaker" doesn't require any prerequisite, but really elevates the level of projects you will attract. 

Speaking allows you to travel, most conferences will at least pay for your travel and hotel. This is Wes's secret link that many do not know about:

<http://lanyrd.com/calls/>

One of the best ways to start to get comfortable with the idea of speaking is to mentor at Ladies Learning Code, Girls Learning Code and Kids Learning Code events. At these one-day events, you'll be matched up with 3-4 learners, and guide them throughout the day as they learn HTML & CSS, JavaScript, design or anything else.

To sign up for the Ladies Learning Code Mentor mailing list, visit <http://ladieslearningcode.com> and click "Tech Help" at the bottom of the page.

To sign up for the Girls/Kids Learning Code Mentor mailing list, fill in this application form: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?usp=drive_web&formkey=dFZTSDBJTl9pUTlPUEpHa1J3ak5hN2c6MA#gid=0>

## Questions to ask

Your personal brand is going to be unique to yourself. So, everything above isn't a list of things you must do, but purely a guideline to get your on the right track.

Asking the right questions will get you started with developing your own personal brand.

1. How do you want others to perceive you? When someone hears your name, what will others think?
2. What is my unique identifier? 
3. Is my online identity consistent? 
4. What shows up when I Google my name? My company name?
5. What kind of projects do I want to work on? 
6. How can I make sure people perceive me as an expert in my area of expertise as soon as possible?

## Your Challenge

Write down a plan so that you accomplish all of the following by the end of Week 9:

- three tweets per day
- three to four awesome blog posts
- an up-to-date and perfected LinkedIn profile
- a professional email address
- an email footer
- at least one side project that is shareable

And make sure you've chosen a specialization and done some work to build your brand in that specific area, such as through blog posts, side projects, etc.

You'll also need a resume shortly after graduating before you can start applying for jobs, so you may want to work on that in the next three weeks if you can (otherwise you probably won't get to it until after the program ends).
