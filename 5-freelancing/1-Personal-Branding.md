# Introduction to freelancing 

Learning how to run a business is an entirely different skillset than learning how to code. Good developers are able to do both and successfully run their own company. 

Working for yourself can be a lot of work, but can provide many freedoms in terms of where, when and who you work with. 

Freelancing notes will be slightly different than our coding notes as the topic of freelancing will be more of a back and forth discussion rather than a technical walk through. Take these notes are more high level ideas that will be expanded on as we discuss. Most of these freelancer sessions will be led by Wes Bos, but some will be led by others.


# Personal Branding 
How others perceive you and your skills is one of the most important parts of being a freelancer. While capability and coding skill matter a lot in regular jobs, your personal brand is just as important as a freelancer when you are getting referrals and reeling in new clients.

## Fake it 'till you make it
As a web developer, you want to be *perceived* as the best in x, y and z. Let's use WordPress for an example. Of course you want to be the best WordPress developer out there, but when you are just starting out, you won't be the best! 

There is always going to be someone who is better at WordPress than you are. The key to still landing gigs is to have others perceive you as someone who would be a good fit for the job. You want your name or company to be synonymous with the sort of projects you want to work on. 

In Wes's case, he worked really hard create a personal brand so that people associated me with web development, more specifically WordPress, and later on JavaScript and HTML5. Eventually, whenever someone mentioned they needed someone to work on WordPress, Wes was the first person that would come to mind. And still is.

## Personal Branding Skeeze

The personal branding space carries around skeeze. Much of the personal branding world revolves around tips, tricks and gimmicks on how to stand out, how to model yourself after Apple Computers. It's often littered with stock images such as:

Personal branding isn't about business cards or a gimmicky fedora that you always wear. It's about creating a **rock solid and well rounded perception*** of yourself, your skills, your work ethic and your business.

We're happy to chat with you one on one about your personal brands throughout the course, but here are some high level aspects to think about. 

## Pick a company name

One question I get fairly often is whether to run your personal brand and company under your own name, under a company name or a mix of the two. All three of these are all fantastic and the decision ultimately comes down to how you see your personal brand unfolding in the future. 

### Wes's personal brand 
When Wes first got started, he spent hours and hours thinking of company names that might work well for him. He ran them past friends until someone asked him:

**"Why would you use a company name? You are _Wes Bos_"**. 

Right then it hit him, he had years of _"Wes Bos, that website guy"_ behind me and it would be a shame to throw it away. Wes is also lucky to have a fairly short, snappy and memorable name. 

A few years later Wes transitioned his freelancing business into a full blown company (albeit just his wife and him), named BosType Inc. Even though they do business under the name **BosType** (e.g. people write cheques to BosType, Inc.), Wes still puts most of his effort into into his "Wes Bos" personal brand.

The reasoning behind this is that Wes knew he wasn't getting into the web development word to grow a huge company, but rather to work for himself. He wants clients to pay me top dollar for my own expertise rather than a company that is good at xyz. He also doesn't have plans to hire other people, pay for an office space, etc.

### Examples

Seth Godin <http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/> — Author, Speaker, Bald

Heather Payne <http://heatherpayne.ca/> — Ladies Learning Code, HackerYou, Investor, Speaker

Wes Bos <http://wesbos.com/> - Freelance Web Developer & Designer, Teacher

### Running under a company name
The above won't be the case for everyone. You may have your goals set on eventually (or immediately) creating a team and blooming into an agency.

Running under a company name isn't always as _personal_ but it certainly can give the impression that your company is larger and more professional than you may actually be. This may allow you to bid on larger projects and have companies take you more seriously. It also affords you the ability to easily grow the company should you choose too in the future. 

### Examples

Frank and Vivian are Studio Function <http://studiofunction.com/>

Nascent <http://nascentdigital.com/>

Happy Cog <http://happycog.com//>

### A mix of both
You may not have a very unique name, so it might not be available on twitter/domains nor google-able.

You may choose to run under an alias or a handle which you have just made up.

## Creating and Investing in a personal brand
Creating a personal brand is extremely valuable and you need to make sure you devote time to creating and maintaining your personal brand. As a freelancer, there will _always_ be work to do and emails to send, so make sure to block time to do so. 

So, _how_ do you do these things?

### Be Loud, vocal, have opinions and share them

THe biggest part of creating your own personal brand is being extremely vocal about what you do. As we said earlier, **you must let everyone know what is it you do.**

Being a freelancer isn't just a job, it's going to be a huge part of your life and you need to make it seem so to others around you. To do this, you must get really involved both within the development community as well as outside of it. 

Many people don't like to talk about themselves or the work they are doing as it can feel braggy. There is a fine line between being obnoxious and keeping people up to date with what you are doing. This is something we all have to learn, and you'll get there eventually...with practice! 

We will go into _how_ you can be vocal in the coming sections. 

### Be Reliable 
There are going to be times in your freelancing career where you will drop the ball, where you won't be able to finish a project on time or where you just need drop a project completely.

These things are going to happen, there is no getting around it. How you handle these situations is very important to your reputation and your personal brand.

Tips on being reliable:

1. Respond to initial inquiry emails as soon as you can.
2. Honour your verbal and written committments
3. No matter how much you hate it, always pick up the phone.
4. If you foresee any issues in project timing, let your client know as soon as possible. A client always prefers transparency over hiding possible problems.
5. If you screw something up, explain the problem along with a solution and time line to get it fixed. 
6. Under promise, over deliver.

It is so important to be a reliable and consistent person when you are freelancing because so many of our leads come from referral. 

You may stumble upon a contact who can refer a few people a month to you. I do this for Wes, and now I do it for bootcamp grads who have started freelancing. By referring you, they are sticking their neck out for you, saying you are the right person for the job. If you flake out, that will get back to them and you have burned a very valuable bridge.

### Fresh
A personal brand isn't something you develop in a few days and then ride out. It's something that you need to be continually working on. At first it may seem like work, but it will soon become second nature as you immerse yourself in being a freelancer.

Whether its tweaking your site design, updating business cards, writing a blog post, tweeting or applying to speak at a conference, you should always be building on your brand.

### Facebook
Facebook seems like the last place you would go to get work. It seems like a very personal and private space for family and friends, not really a space where many converse with industry people.

However, Facebook is an awesome tool for building your personal brand. Facebook is a gold mine of people who already trust you and would love to recommend you, if they just knew what you did. 

So, I'm not saying to create a facebook page and spam everyone in your list, but rather share links to websites you are building, share pictures of your Hackeryou experience, tell everyone you build websites and are available for work.

For example, Wes often gets messages from people on facebook saying something like this:

> Hey Wes, hows it going? Long time no talk! Anyways, I see that you are always doing website stuff and I was wondering if you were interested in doing something for my (dad's|uncle's|sister's|friend's brother in law) company.

Even if you haven't talked to people on facebook in years, they still see what you are doing. The moment someone asks for a web developer, you will instantly come to their mind. 


#### Filtering

But.. facebook is for true friends! I delete people all the time!

Never delete anyone from facebook! They are extremely valuable for referrals. Instead, create sharing profiles with limited access. Don't want that creep from highschool to see your baby pictures? No problem at all, just create a filter where he can only see publicly posted items.


### Have a tweet-length, a short, and a long bio
One of the hardest things to do is to write about yourself. Every freelancer needs to have a bio written about themselves and have it handy for when the need arises. 

What often happens is you will be featured in some sort of fashion that requires a bio. Whether it be a LLC mentor spotlight, a blog post or in a speakers lineup for a conference. These are always needed ASAP and are often rushed out the door.

You should have a ready-to-go bios that are tweet-length (for your twitter bio and short intros), a short few sentences (for the quick intro on a blog post), and a longer one for your own website.

Writing a bio is hard, I usually start by writing down what I want to get across by answering the following questions:

1. Who am I
2. What do I do?
3. What/who do I work with?
4. What am I passionate about?
5. Where can you find me?
6. A call to action to get in touch

If you have a friend who is good with words, buy them a beer in trade for a little copy writing. 

#### Examples

Twitter-length:

@vivianhui:

> Toronto web / interaction / mobile / print graphic designer. Founding Partner of @studiofunction. Likes: the future. Dislikes: olden times.

Quick intro:

@wesbos:

> I'm Wes Bos, a web developer, UI designer and speaker from Toronto. I love business, the internet, cutting edge technology and best practices. I've been creating websites for around 9 years and have become pretty good at it. I hang out on Twitter and would love to meet you.

<http://wesbos.com/about/>

Longer bio:

@heatherpayne

> Hi! I'm Heather Payne. I live in Toronto, Canada, and I'm the founder of HackerYou and Ladies Learning Code. My team and I also run Girls Learning Code and Kids Learning Code. I was ShopLocket's first investor, the founding director of Toronto's Mozilla-backed youth digital literacy initiative, and I'm currently learning Ruby on Rails.

> I'm really passionate about showing people - and, especially, women and girls - that they can do anything they put their mind to, whether it's learning to code, starting a business, investing in a startup, or taking on some other exciting challenge. And, yes, I coded this website myself.

### Avatars & Print pictures

Ditch the picture of your cat and get a real, high quality photo of yourself taken. Having a consistent avatar that shows your face makes people feel at ease when dealing with you. They know you are a real person. 

Have large, high resolution version of your photo available for anyone who asks. When you are featured on a website or in print, the last thing you want is someone pulling a photo from 4 years ago that they found on Google images. 

Take care of your visual identity and always keep it up to date.

Eventually, you might want to set up a page like this: <http://heatherpayne.ca/official-bio>

### Blog
You have probably already been told this a million times, but having a blog is _so_ crucial to the success of a freelancer or front-end developer. You're trying to break in to a new industry, and it's going to take some extra work. By sharing what you know — be it about technology, business, or life — you will automatically be perceived as an expert in that area.

I know, blogging is hard. That's why no one does it. That's why blogging is going to make you stand out.

Wes often shares short tutorials or examples of code that he found helpful on his blog. These are not only helpful to other developers, but clients can see that you really know your stuff. A bunch of students in the last cohort did a great job blogging throughout their time here. Here are some examples:

Amy Allen (now a front-end developer at Demac Media): http://amyallen.ca/blog/
Gab White (returning to her job in Halifax as a front-end developer, not just a designer): http://gabwhite.com/
Danielle Webb (full-time freelancer): http://danielleawebb.com/blog/

### Twitter
Tell people what do you in your twitter bio, air on the side of bragging. Look important. This will show people that you are really involved and interesting to follow.

### Email Address
Having a professional email address on your own domain will really up the level of your credibility. Ditch SoccerGurl88@hotmail.com and sign up for a real email provider. 

I recommend using Google Apps as it is exactly like Gmail. This will allow you to create an email address @yourdomain.com. You can also create alias to other domain names.

I have 1 google apps account setup for wesbos.com, kaitbos.com and bostype.com.

<http://www.google.ca/enterprise/apps/business/>

It is no longer free, but well worth the $50/year per user.

Christopher also found a way to set up a personal email address for free through Bluehost, so you can ask him about it.

### Speak at conferences 

This is a scary thing to do. The first time someone asked me to speak, it was at a small meetup of about 100 people and I was terrified. I thought I didn't know enough to be a speaker. 

Once you speak and attend enough conferences, you will learn that each person is just sharing what they know about a certain area.

Take some time to really learn a certain topic — CSS3 Animations and Transitions — and put together a 25 min talk. You can then submit this to conferences and local meetups and possibly go deliver it. 

Being a "speaker" doesn't require any prerequisite, but really elevates the level of projects you will attract. 

Speaking allows you to travel, most conferences will at least pay for your travel and hotel. This is my secret link many do not know about:

<http://lanyrd.com/calls/>

One of the best ways to start to get comfortable with the idea of speaking is to mentor at Ladies Learning Code, Girls Learning Code and Kids Learning Code events. At these one-day events, you'll be matched up with 3-4 learners, and guide them throughout the day as they learn HTML & CSS, JavaScript, design or anything else.

## Questions to ask

Your personal brand is going to be unique to yourself. So, everything above isn't a list of things you must do, but purely a guideline to get your on the right track.

Asking the right questions will get you started with developing your own personal brand.

1. How do you want others to perceive you? When someone hears your name, what will others think?
2. What is my unique identifier? 
3. Is my online identity consistent? 
4. What shows up when I Google my name? My company name?
5. What kind of projects do I want to work on? 
6. How will I position myself as a freelancer? 
7. How can I make sure people perceive me as an expert in my area of expertise as soon as possible?
