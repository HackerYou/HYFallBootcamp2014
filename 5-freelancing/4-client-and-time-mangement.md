# Client and Time Management
Managing both your time as well as your clients requests can take up a large portion of your day. 

It's important to learn how to properly manage these things so you can focus on the paying parts of your job.

## Client Management

Communication with your clients is extremely important, however, you will find that some clients can eat up a large part of your working day. How do we balance both our clients and the work we need to do for them?

### Skip email, Use Project Management Systems

Email is great for conversing with a client initially, but once things turn into back and forth about a website specifics, email can get out of control very quickly. This is especially true when you work on projects with more than 2 people. 

To make things much more manageable, we can use a project management tool. This allows you to make your conversations modular and easier to track.

Such tools include:

* Basecamp
* RedMine
* Asana
* Projecturf
* Trello

All of the above, with the exception of Trello, work on a "thread" based system similar to email. You can create a message/post, say "Website Navigation Errors" and proceed to converse on that topic. Any files or notes about that specific need stay in the thread.

Trello is a little different as it a more visual way to see what needs to be done. Each topic/issue/request is a "card" in which you can discuss, upload files and assign tasks and to-do lists. 

Trello is great because you can have columns of cards and drag/drop them into meaning full categories. Let's look at a few examples now. 

### Phone Calls
This tip is simple, but very effective. Just call your clients. Time spent emailing back and forth is often wasted. When a client is asking questions or feeling worried about something, call them and talk it through. They often hang up the phone feeling reassured about the project. 

### Face-to-face meetings

When possible, have face to face visits every so often with your clients. Seeing them in person will often strengthen your relationships and give you an idea for the personality of your client.

All too often the tone of an email is totally lost or misinterpreted. Having a face to face meeting, you can much more easily judge tone and body language.

When not possible, use Google Hangouts or Skype with a client. Always better than just email, or just voice. 

## Time Management

Managing your time is another tough part of being a freelancer or just a developer in general.

There will always be more work to do. There will always be more to learn. While we encourage you to hustle and make it work, you also need to make sure that you are getting your breaks. 

If and when you find your are way too busy, it might be worth taking a look at _how_ you work and see if there are ways you can improve and speed up.

In other words, can we hack our time spent working? 

### What your day looks like

What does a general day in the life of a freelancer look like? 

Every freelance developer is different and you will find what works for you. With the flexibility of being a freelancer, you can _somewhat_ pick your own hours.

Some developers get up really early and finish early, some split their day into two major chunks.

Let's hear from Dara and Wes as to what a regular day looks like for them.

### Working from space vs. from Home
Working from home means that you need a defined space to do your work. Ideally this would be a home office where you clearly have a separate space where you work. This will help with your transition from work to home and keep them separate.

Should you work from home? It really depends on your personality type. I love to work from home becausse there are no distractions. With things like IRC chat, twitter and meetups, I don't find it lonely at all. 

Others miss office life, being with other people they can talk to and other developers with who they can talk shop with. If you fall into this category, it is worth looking into renting a desk at a co-working space.

There are tons of places that let you rent a desk by the day (~$25) or the month (~$250). Here are a few:

- CSI Hot Desk
- Bento Miso
- Camaraderie

### Blocking Off Time
When you need to do specific tasks, it is ideal if you can block off time that will be dedicated to it. Don't just do email whenever you wish to, block off some time to do this every day. Many developers find that they are best at coding in the morning, so email is answered around 3:00. 

Same goes for tasks that might happen not so often. Need to do your invoicing and book keeping? Block off 45 mins a week. I like to do mine Fridays at 5:00. Want to blog? Make time for it every week.
