# Finding and Winning Clients

Finding clients for established freelancers is incredibly easy. Finding clients for beginner freelancers can be tough, but it doesn't have to be. Since a large majority of your clients will come from referrals, breaking into the referral scene will take some work.

## Job Boards and Online listings
You won't find good work on job boards. Any time someone posts online saying that they are looking for a freelance web developer, one of the two things will happen:

1. The poster is looking for free or undervalued work. This isn't work your time. See Craigslist. 
2. THe poster will get a million responses. Both from local developers who are desperate for work (bid to the bottom) as well as offshore development teams which are very popular in countries where the cost of living is much lower. 

We have all handed out a million resumes before, knowing that it will just go into a pile with the others. Getting work from job boards is no different. 

## Meetups and Conferences 
Meetups and conferences are all about the sheer number of awesome people that you can meet in a short amount of time. Some meetups will be a bust, and some will be full of fantastic resources. As cheezy as it is, Take business cards and hand them out. Follow up on twitter the next day saying something like "Awesome meeting you last night, hope to bump into you again. Good luck with  [insert what they are working on]"

## Twitter and Facebook
We have already talked about this exhaustively, but you need to always be sharing what you are working on, and what you know. We are 2 weeks into HackerYou, if you haven't already tweeted/facebooked at least 20 things about web development/hackeryou, you are hurting yourself.

Share:

* Links and Resources â€” HackerYou is full of awesome tools and resources, share them! 
* Links to sites you built. Don't hide them on your computer, post them online for the world to see
* Photos on what you are building
* Photos of people coding on the couches
* Interesting tidbits about CSS. How border-box works, CSS hacks, etc..
* Links to interesting code pen examples. Even better if they are your own

Engage:
* See what other people on twitter are talking about. Tweet at people who are talking about HTML/CSS/JavaScript/WordPress and get involved in the conversation. 


You'll never join the community if you sit by the sidelines and just watch.

## Blogging
Blog about what you want to get paid to do. If you really like CSS3, blog about it. If you really like WordPress, blog about it. 

By blogging about a topic you really like, you will position yourself as the expert in that area. People will notice as well as find you on Google and proceed to hire you for these things. 

We have said this before. Blogging takes a lot of time and effort, but even small 20-min blog posts will help you gain clients. In two years, the momentum from having a full blog will be an invaluable asset. 

## Agencies
Agencies are huge for finding well-paying jobs. There are three ways you can benefit from becoming friends with agencies.

1. When agencies are busy and do not have enough staff, they will often bring on a freelancer to help with the workload. Since you are not on their payroll, taking up deskspace or using their benefits, you can earn much more than a regular employee.
2. Agencies will sometimes get projects that are outside their talent pool. Agencies often will bring me on for work specific to things I blog about - JavaScript and Wordpress. Since they aren't able to do it in house, they hire me
3. Agencies take a _large_ projects. Generally anything under 5-10k isn't worth their time. So, clients who come to the agency with "smaller" budgets, get refereed to a list of known, reputable freelancers. For a freelancer, 5-10k can be _huge_, so grab that chaff. 

## Lunch, Beer, Coffee
Once you have a few clients, its tempting to stay indoors and no longer make it out the events. It is so important to keep up your relationships, no matter how busy you are. 

Find time to ask people in the industry to have lunch/coffee/beer every once in a while. This will keep you at the top of their mind, and they will be much more likely to refer you to a project. 

This is especially true when you see on twitter that someone is visiting Toronto from another city/country. A $7 sushi lunch turned into 30k worth of work for me from a single client.

## Build bridges, don't burn them
We talked about this last week, but it is important to note this again. Keep your clients and those who refer you happy. 

Say thanks for the referral if you were referred. I don't pay for leads, but I will buy them lunch or a small thank you gift. 

## Don't be the busy girl/guy!!!
No matter how busy you are, don't lead on that you are "UGH SO BUSY". This can be dangerous, because no one likes to bug the busy guy. 

I often have people ask me if it's okay that they send clients my way. As if the client was not worthy of my dev skills because of being busy. Always be open to leads, always take the time to take to someone even if you **are** busy. 

If someone is sending an introduction to you, make them feel comfortable with that. 

## Tell people what services you offer
You should have a section or a page on your website that goes into an exhaustive list of services you provide. Often people will be looking for something specific rather than just a "web developer" and they want to know you are good at that.

On my website, I specifically tell people I'm good with jQuery and WordPress. Even though jQuery is JavaScript and WordPress isPHP, clients know the words jQuery and WordPress and gravitate to someone who says they know them. I also have a longer list of skills on <http://wesbos.com/about>.
