# Presentations

Being a good freelance developer is about more than just technical skills, you need to feel very comfortable communicating ideas. Throughout this course you will get many opportunities to practice your speaking skills.

You will be giving presentations in groups of 2 (3 if necessary). With 25 students this means twelve groups will present over 7 weeks. The first week is a bit early for presentations and the last week is dedicated for the demo day.

Two groups will present each of the seven weeks. This means 14 presentations; two groups can present twice if they want to!

## Forming Groups

By the end of the first week you will have a group and know when you will be presenting. There is some dedicated time on Thursday (2nd block) to form groups and pick a time slot for presentations.

## Duration

The presentations should be 5-10 minutes long. After the presentation there will be another 5-10 minutes to answer questions (from both instructors and fellow students). This means prepare for a 10 to 20 minutes presentation.

### Available time slots

Week 2: Thursday 2nd block
Week 3: Thursday 2nd block
Week 4: Thursday 2nd block
Week 5: Friday 2nd block
Week 6: Friday 2nd block
Week 7: Friday 1st block
Week 8: Friday 1st block

## Format

These presentations will resemble "[lightning talks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk)" that are commonly seen at tech meet ups and conferences. Your job is to deliver a succinct, energetic, and passionate presentation to get a point across very quickly. You can use power point slides but avoid putting too much text on them.

* use images and/or a little text
* make eye contact with the audience
* don't talk too fast, the point is to be understood not to say words
* the point of your presentation should be clear early on
* be ready to take questions after the presentation

Practice your presentation before giving it and try to not take it too seriously (i.e. don't get stressed out).

## What to present?

You can literally talk about anything during your presentation as long as it somewhat pertains to web development. For example:

* Talk about your favourite library, framework, add-on, plugin, etc.
* Share your experience with a successful project. What did you learn? Why was it so much fun?
* Share your experience with a failed project. Again... what did you learn? Why do you think you failed?
* You want to work on project X and want people to collaborate with. What do you need? Why should people join you?
* X is broken in web development, tell us all about it. Why? Do you have any ideas how it can be fixed?
* You found a great resource for learning X, tell us all about it.
* Show us how you implemented feature X.
* Talk about a technique you learned for doing X.
* etc.
