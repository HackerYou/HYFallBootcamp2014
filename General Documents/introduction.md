# Welcome to HackerYou Full-Time Bootcamp

The full-time program is nine weeks of concentrated and accelerated learning. Expect to spend every weekday (Monday to Friday) from 10 AM to 6 PM at HackerYou. It's up to you what you want to do outside of these hours although rest would be a good idea.

## Prerequisite to learning
Learning is probably one of the most studied phenomena in the world. Learning literally involves the rewiring of your brain and that takes a lot of energy and raw materials. Research also clearly points to the important role the sleep plays in learning and memory. So if there is one point that you take from this document then make sure it's this:

> You cannot learn well unless you are in good mental and physical health.

This means:

* Get a good night's sleep
* Eat a healthy & balanced diet. `BreakFast.is("important")`
* Exercise lightly (e.g. walk to class)

Don't force the learning. Don't stress out about your progress. Don't stay up all night coding.

## Start of day
At 10 AM every morning the class will get together briefly to:

* Go over the agenda for the day.
* Discuss how everyone is feeling about their progress and respond to your feedback.

Learning is a shared responsibility between you and the instructors so be vocal. If you need the instructor to slow down or repeat something then say so. If you need help then say so.

## Time blocks
The days are broken down into two time blocks: 10 am to 3 pm (includes lunch) and 3 pm to 6 pm. There will be a lesson or exercise planned for each time block.

"Lesson" means a lecture or an activity that is directly supervised and led by the instructors. Lessons will be used to introduce new topics/concepts.

An "exercise" involves you working in groups to do some exploration. An "exercise" could be in the form of a "fake" client request, a challenge or a prompt/question. The exercises are intended to help you gain skills that freelance developers really need (i.e. research, perseverance, autodidacticism, etc.).

The curriculum and the instructors are relatively flexible so if you find that you prefer a certain type of activity (eg. lesson vs. exercise) then give us your feedback. 

## End of day
The last hour or so of the class will be dedicated to self-assessment and reflection. There is a "self-assessment" document with more information. Monitoring your own learning isn't a trivial task so it will take discipline. 

It's crucial that you take this course one day at a time. There are learning goals/expectations for each day to help you keep track of your progress. If you get behind then ask for help; use the vocabulary in the learning expectations to better articulate your needs. The instructors will be available full-time to answer questions so make use of this resource.

If you accomplish the learning expectations and want more then assign yourself something more challenging. If you don't know what challenge to tackle next then consider talking to the instructors to get some inspiration.
