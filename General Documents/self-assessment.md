# Self-Assessment in or outside “school” hours

## Daily

* Review day’s curriculum. How do you feel about this material? If you’re not feeling well then come up with a good question. If you’re doing well then what else do you want to learn?
* Summarize what was learned everyday as a recipe/gist to be added to gistboxapp.com. Remember to label the gists (by technology, day, week, w/e).

## Weekly (on Fridays)
Review week’s curriculum and have some questions ready for the Q/A session.


# CURRI

At the beginning use CURRI to let the instructors know your knowledge and comfort level with the material. The instructors will use this information to better serve your needs.

* Each day is a "track" on CURRI. Each "checkpoint" is a learning expectations or goal for that day.
* At the end of the day go through the checkpoints and self-assess. 
* Early the next day the instructors will go over this data and respond to your needs.
