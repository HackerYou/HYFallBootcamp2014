# Self-Assessment in or outside “school” hours

## Daily

* Review day’s curriculum. How do you feel about this material? If you’re not feeling well then come up with a good question. If you’re doing well then what else do you want to learn?
* Summarize what was learned everyday as a recipe/gist to be added to gistboxapp.com. Remember to label the gists (by technology, day, week, w/e).

## Weekly (on Fridays)
Review week’s curriculum and have some questions ready for the Q/A session.
