# Self-Assessment

Self-assessment is the act of thinking about and monitoring our own learning. It's about "owning" our learning and taking full responsibility for it. Apparently, we learn far more by reflecting on our experiences than by going through these experiences without reflection. If you're interested, this is called metacognition.

This should not take too much of your time. At the end of each day spend just 20-30 minutes doing the following:

1. Look at the day’s learning goals in CURRI. How do you feel about these goals? Click the face indicating your level of comfort with the content. If you’re not feeling well then come up with a good question. If you’re doing well then what else do you want to learn?
2. Summarize key points as a recipe/gist to be added to gistboxapp.com. Remember to label the gists (by technology, day, week, w/e).

Learning is a shared responsibility so self-assessment doesn't mean you are on your own. Early the next day the instructors will go over the self-assessment data from CURRI and respond to the class's needs.

If you have questions that are pressing then ask an instructor or peer as soon as possible. CURRI allows you to get into a help queue, just click the "I need help" link. If the question can wait then save it for the Weekly Q/A sessions that will happen every Friday.

## CURRI

During this course we will be piloting an education app created by HackerYou alumni. CURRI is an app that allows you to anonymously share how you feel about each of the learning expectations. The instructors will use this information to better serve the class's needs. Each day is a "track" on CURRI. Each "checkpoint" is one of many learning expectations or goals for that day.

CURRI is a great demonstration of what people just like you (i.e. HackerYou alumni) can do with HTML/CSS and programming. The app is very much in "alpha" so if you have any suggestions, comments or feedback then don't hesitate to use the in-app form.
