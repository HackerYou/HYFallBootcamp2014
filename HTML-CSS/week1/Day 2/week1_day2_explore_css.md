# Week 1, Day 2 Explore CSS

You now know a bit about CSS. In groups of 2-3 people explore the web to answer the following questions. The questions are intentionally vague and only serve as a starting pointâ€¦ learn as much as you can so that you have something interesting to share with the rest of the class.

- The markup for this exercise is in `explore_css_exercise.html`. Where do you put the CSS to add style?
- How do you write a CSS rule that applies to all "p" elements on a page? What are these rules called?
- How would you write a rule that only applies to the third paragraph.
- how would you write a rule that only applies to the first paragraph (hint: you can change the markup by adding attributes but do not nest elements like in the above example).

- What happens when you write two rules for a single element? Come up with some guidelines for predicting which rules apply.

<p>What colour am I?</p>
<style>
	p {
		color:red;
	}

	p {
		color:purple;
	}
</style>

- How would you add a CSS rule that makes a paragraph change colour upon hovering over it with a mouse?
