# Week 1, Day 5 Challenge (Debug broken code)

Throughout the course you will be presented with challenges that are intended to simulate common skills and tasks that web developers need. Today's challenge involves sifting through code to find and fix bugs and "bad practices". You can work individually or in pairs for this challenge.

Open "fail_html_page.html" to get started.


## Teacher notes
The file will have the following bugs or bad practices:

- nothing in title
- no box-sizingâ€¦ so padding messes up layout
- no clearfix
- tags that are not closed (div, anchor tag)
- improperly nested tags
- improper HTML and CSS indentation
- class name like "stuff" which doesn't say anything meaningful
- use of inline styles
- use of long form CSS when an easy short-hand is available
- use of IDs instead of classes
- elements with two class attributes
- multiple css rules with the same styles
- css syntax problems
	* missing semicolon
	* missing # for colours
	* naming classes with capital letters
	* badly formatted comments
