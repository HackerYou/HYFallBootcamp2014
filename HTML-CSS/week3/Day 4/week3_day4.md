# Week 3, Day 4

# Frameworks, frameworks, frameworks!

By now you have probably heard of frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation.

These are pre-built toolboxes of HTML, CSS and JavaScript that allow you to quickly mock up a website or application. They include many pre-styled elements for common things like grids, buttons, forms and icons. Most of them also provide some sort of framework for building a responsive website.

All of these frameworks work similarity to each other. You add classes to your elements which then apply a set of default styles.

These frameworks are extremely helpful in a few situations:

1. Back end developers who aren't strong in front end development can easily get a basic interface up.
1. Designers/developers can easily prototype an interface inside the browser, rather than in photoshop
1. Helpers for things are are a pain (like aligning lables and inputs) are fairly easy.

So, why haven't we used frameworks in our class?

1. These frameworks do not teach you how to code CSS, they teach you how to add class names to elements. It's very easy to skirt through and not learn how underlying CSS works. Knowing why and how floats, display block vs inline, et all works is crucial to building websites and web apps. 

I've seen many people use these frameworks over learning CSS and the questions quickly change from "Why is my float/div/clear/typography acting like this" to "how do I code this in bootstrap". 

1. Creativity is smashed. These frameworks give you a set of pre-designed elements which most people use to lay out their website. It can be very hard to think outside the box when you start with a very specific one. 

If you have a really good understanding of HTML and CSS, these frameworks are fantastic as they will speed up your workflow. Just make sure the framework isn't a blackbox with unknown internals.


## Let's take a look!

The two most popular frameworks are [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap) and [Foundation](foundation.zurb.com). A new player recently launched by Adobe is [TopCoat](http://topcoat.io/).

We will be taking a look at bootstrap today. Let's work our way through each of the following:

* Grids and Containers
* Typography
* Forms
* Buttons
* Navigations
* Labels
* & whatever else we find!

## Addons

Bootstrap is based on creating very modular peices of HTML and CSS that can be plopped into any existing HTML document. This way, if you only need a certain part of bootstrap, then you can just steal that part and leave the rest behind!

That means that the open source community has taken to creating little snippets for things you may need. [http://bootsnipp.com/](http://bootsnipp.com/) is a great resource for this. Let's take a look!
