# JavaScript Content "Dry Run"

- what programming experience do the students have?
- this isn't a lecture, more a tutoring session
- ask questions at any point in time
- confusion is expected but their feedback will be valuable. So give feedback.


# Feedback Day 1 & part of 2

## Part 1 (~10 am => ~12:10 pm) Conclusions:

* explain type as "kind" of value (number=>no quotes, string=>quotes)
* focus on values a bit more
* spend time on definitions
* more examples and practice with just values (before getting to variables, so number operations, string concatenation, etc.)
* math can be scary? maybe it would be less intimidating if given in web-dev/design context?
* summary/recap before exercises
* do exercises together and then get students to do an exercise on their own
* avoid talking about things people haven't learned yet. Like: "There are more types (including undefined and boolean) but we'll cover them when appropriate."

## Part 2 (~1 pm => ~5 pm) Conclusions:

- remind students that it helps to declare variables at the top (and they can comma separate them)
- students struggle with syntax: common errors `functionName ()`, a space is placed between the name and the parenthesis. 
- formatting if/else statements and placing the brackets in the right place (stylistically) is difficult.
- tell students that variable names should be meaningful
- there is confusion about variables names and "strings". When do we put quotation marks and when we don't. 
- students like seeing the instructor find an answer to a problem by searching google. It shows that they don't have to know everything. 
- after pair programming (if/else exercises) have more exercises for students to do alone
- complex conditions are kinda hard
- translating a problem written in a natural language (english) to computer language is tough. students don't know where to start.
- cover combining conditionals (&&, ||)
- lots and lots of practice, like fizz buzz
- recursion might be too complicated
- jQuery example useful for explaining use of recursion
- charIsVowel(“b”) is confusing... be consistent by using `charIsVowel(character)` or `charIsVowel(c)`
- more exercises incorporating stuff already done
