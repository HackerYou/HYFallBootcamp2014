Solving problems

**Make sure we understand the problem**

Problems usually involve `input => procedure => output`.

## Don't:

- panic
- start writing code
- search google (unless this isn't a learning exercise)
- work out an algorithm that solves problem

## Steps:

1. **Understand inputs**: what are the valid inputs? type of inputs? Validate input (be defensive... )
2. **Understand outputs**: what are the outputs? return or print? what type?
3. work out examples by hand to understand relationship between input and out. Use these later as test cases. For each example provide an input and predict an output. Think: how would a human solve this problem systematically?
4. write algorithm **pseudocode**, a simple mechanical solution. Ask "does this handle most cases?". Often humans solve problems not in a systematic way. Think about a simple solution. Humans take shortcuts but computers don't have to. Computers can solve problems in a brain-dead way... because they're fast. If a for loop is about 1000 machine instructions and we're doing a problem that's looping 365k times then that would take  about 0.03 seconds for a processor that can do 1B operations per second... 
5. Don't optimize prematurely. Milliseconds is good enough for most situations. Let's worry about performance when we have to.
6. Develop incrementally and test often. Break problem down. Simplify by making assumptions. Perfect later. Get something working... rather than a perfect answer. Get close to an answer.
7. Deal with the real world challenges. Get correct answer.


## Ideas:

- students create problems for others to solve
