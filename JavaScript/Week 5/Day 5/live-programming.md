# Week 5, Day 5: jQuery Plugins

During this lesson the instructor will code live to demonstrate how they would go about solving an issue/task.

The task: the UI that the instructor is working on consists of a grid of boxes. The position of the boxes matter, users need to be able to sort these boxes.

- what would we use for this? css? Javascript? with jQuery? Solution: JavaScript and jQuery.
- take a moment to discuss what is required to code such a thing from scratch
- search the internet for a jQuery plugin that would do the job. What search terms would you use? What websites would you search? Solution: combination of "drag and drop", "jQuery plugin", "grid sort", "drag and sort". Possible directory: unheap.com.
- there are many solutions, which one should we go with? What should we consider? Solution: check github (last commit more recent for gridster), major project "Dashing" uses gridster, features (gridster has many more features - both a pro and con)
- Use http://gridster.net/ for this demo
- Read the documentation together and look at the demos
- Build the markup
- Load jQuery and gridsterjs
- Add the literally three lines of code that is required to make this work.

2nd Task: Do students have a suggestion. Is there a functionality that they want to implement? Follow the same process again, except of course this time without prepared material.
