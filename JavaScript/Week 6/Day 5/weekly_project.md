# Weekly Project

Your task for the weekly project is to create your very own movie app. 

## Minimum Requirements

* A custom style/design.
* A list of Movies or TV shows of your choice.
* The ability to rate the movies/shows using a real user session (we used a guest session in our tutorial).

* Have fun.
