# Introduction to Wordpress

Wordpress is a Content Management System (CMS) first developed in 2001. It is a piece of software that can be used to create websites and blogs.  

## Why Wordpress?

Many reasons but here are a few:

* free and open source
* thousands of free and commercial plugins to add functionality
* thousands of beautiful free and commercial themes
* Mature and stable product
* Actively being developed
* Huge community (forums, mailing lists, conferences, etc.)
* Powers more than 17% of the web
* Flexible, meaning you can make a personal blog/website, a photoblog, a business website, a professional portfolio, a government website, a magazine or news website, an online community, etc.
* Beautiful admin interface that is very easy to use.
* Easy to install and keep up to date

## Wordpress.com vs. Wordpress.org

The Wordpress software can be downloaded from Wordpress.org and then you will need to host the software on your own server. Wordpress.com is a service, they will host the software for you (for a price of course). To get the full power of Wordpress we'll need to host Wordpress ourselves (the Wordpress.com service is somewhat limited).

## Hosting Wordpress

Wordpress requires a certain environment to properly work. We need:

1. Operating system: Linux (Windows and Mac work for development)
2. Server: Apache
3. Database: MySQL
4. Back-end Language: PHP

The environment that is used in production for Wordpress is called a **LAMP** stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).
