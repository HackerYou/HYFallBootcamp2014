# Custom Themes

As a class we're going to create a custom theme, test it and package it. 

## Where to start?

We could code everything from scratch but the reality is that most websites require the same components. We need a navigation, some widgets, a blog, pages, etc. So we'll start with a starter theme. These themes don't have any style but they are a good starting point.

**Examples**:

* http://themble.com/bones/
* http://underscores.me/
* Wes github one


**Why use starter themes?**

* Modern HTML5 markup
* Most of the PHP template tags that we need already added
* Good defaults for CSS
* Files already organized into folders
* Commented code that we can learn from
* 1000-hour head start! (idk about this one...)

## Download, Install and Activate

## Build a theme

What do we want to build? Typical blog/personal website?

Use an HTML/CSS template. 

## Test the theme

Using test data/content will help us see more components so that we can design them.
