How to pick good plugins:

* is it up to date? Is it compatible with current version of WP?
* how many downloads? more = better
* Good ratings?
* Is the support good? Check the support tab to see how many issues are still open.
* who are the authors? how many plugins do they have? are they active?
* ask around (twitter, friends, etc.) for best plugins
