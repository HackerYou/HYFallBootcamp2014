# Wordpress Troubleshooting

**Where to get help?**

- Wordpress documentation/codex is super helpful. Almost everything is there. Common problems can be seen here: http://codex.wordpress.org/Troubleshooting
- Google, Stack-overflow and the Wordpress forums are extremely useful if you can't find a solution to your problem in the codex.
- copy/paste the error into google.

**Words of advise:**

* be persistent. most problems take a bit of time to solve
* word your question as well as you can and your chances of being answered are higher.
* most questions have already been asked you just need to think about how to phrase your search query.
* take some time off if you get too frustrated.
* See every issue/problem as a great learning opportunity
* Get used to not knowing the answer - you'll do a lot of searching as a freelancer
