# Update Wordpress

With version 3.7, Wordpress will automatically update to all minor patches. Major patches still require you to request an update.

Updating Wordpress is simple. You pretty much just click a link and wait for it to update.

## Precautions & consequences

The new Wordpress might not be compatible with your theme or a plugin. So the website might "break". So what to do?

* Test upgrade on your local machine first
* Backup your Wordpress so that you can undo bad upgrades.

## Backup Wordpress

* Manually copy the folder
* Go into phpmyadmin and download copy of SQL file

There are services that can help do automatic backups like wpremote. There are plugins that will do the same.
