# Weekly Project

Your goal for this week is to transform your personal Wordpress website into a proper portfolio by using custom post types. By the end of the week you should have both a front and back-end setup so that showing your work becomes much easier.

* From the admin panel you should be able to add "works" to your portfolio without having to touch your code. The interface should allow you to add a title, description, image etc. for each of the works.
* The front end should display the portfolio pieces. This is an opportunity to get creative and to use all of the design, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery knowledge that you have acquired so far.
