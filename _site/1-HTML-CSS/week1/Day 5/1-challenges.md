# Week 1, Day 5 Challenges

> Throughout the course you will be presented with challenges that are intended to help you gain skills that web developers really need. You are encouraged to work in pairs for these challenges. To give you extra motivation for the exercises we have spent countless hours coming up with cheesy ways to introduce the challenges!


## Challenge 1
Dr. When, a time-traveling entrepreneur, had a beautiful website but it was unfortunately hacked by his greatest enemies. So your task today is to cleanup the mess. Sift through the code to find and fix bugs and "bad practices". Don't worry about the content, he'll take care of that later. Open "challenge_1.html" to get started.
	
## Challenge 2
Mystique is a cat with big dreams... she wants to expand her catnip business. To do that she learned a bit of HTML and built a website. She's having difficulty centring an element both horizontally and vertically so she has hired you. Your challenge is to centre the element both horizontally and vertically so that it's exactly in the centre of the page. The element has a fixed width and height.
