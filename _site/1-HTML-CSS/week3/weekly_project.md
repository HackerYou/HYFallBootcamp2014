# Weekly Project

This week you will be build a responsive multi-page website for a "fake" client. We will provide you with 3-5 designs to choose from (desktop and mobile).

## Requirements

1. It must be entirely responsive. When I resize my browser it should resize with it.
2. It should be using the latest techniques we have learned in class


### Motivation
I encourage you to think **outside what you think you can do and push yourself**. The best way to learn, is to jump in over your head. We have lots of help here to get you on the right path and tackling something difficult is very rewarding.

If you have ideas that you aren't sure are possible, please run them by us. Usually the JavaScript dependent stuff can be done in a few lines of JS and myself or the mentors have no problem helping you with that!
