<h2 id="ux-user-experience-design">UX (User Experience) Design</h2>

<p>User experience design is about enabling visitors to effectively and enjoyably use your website. Good UX is informed by many different disiplines - design, psychology, communication - but a lot of it comes down to plain old common sense. You’re a user of the web too! Try to keep in mind sites you find easy to use or features that frustrate you as a web user.</p>

<h3 id="exercise-what-grinds-your-gears">Exercise: What Grinds Your Gears?</h3>
<p>Share a bad user experience you’ve had on a website and discuss how you might fix it.</p>

<h3 id="establishing-user-goals">Establishing user goals</h3>

<p>When crafting your user experience, you need to first think about what you want users to be able to accomplish on your site.</p>

<p>Some goals will be universal. For example,</p>

<ul>
  <li>users should be able to find their way easily around your site</li>
  <li>content should be easy to digest</li>
</ul>

<p>Some will be specific to the site you’re building. For example,</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>artist website:</em> users should be able to view the artist’s works</li>
  <li><em>e-commerce website:</em> it should be easy for users to browse product selection</li>
  <li><em>responsive site:</em> everything must be touch-friendly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Once your goals have been established, make your UX decisions based on whether or not those goals will be met.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> easy to digest content
<strong>Good UX:</strong> using clear and consice wording, adjusting paragraph line-height to make text more legible,  use of headings to establish a content heirarchy</p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> browse product selection easily on an e-commerce site
<strong>Good UX:</strong> displaying thumbnails on a product listing page, allowing users to browse variations without leaving the list view:</p>

<p>Another good way to come up with killer UI components is to leverage existing <strong>design patterns</strong> on the web. There’s a reason most websites have a navigation bar across the top of the screen. It’s an established design pattern that allows for easy movement through a website.</p>

<p>In addition to browsing design galleries, have a look at some pattern libraries and tried and tested UI(User Interface) strategies when building your designs.</p>

<p><strong>UX Myths</strong></p>

<p><strong>A word of caution:</strong> Not everything that’s popular is good UI design! Web design can be prone to fads, so always ask yourself if a design pattern is <em>functional</em> before implementing it.</p>
