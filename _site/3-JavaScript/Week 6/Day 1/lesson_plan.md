# Lesson Plan

Think of the 2nd block today as a rest stop. Chances are students are a bit overwhelmed so this is a good point to take a little break. Use this time to go over the self-assessment data and focus on the parts that students are really struggling with.

Review the JavaScript that students have learned so far and give students an opportunity to ask questions in an open Q/A session.

If the majority of the students are doing well then that's great! Give everyone free time to do whatever they want. The advanced students can explore the optional material (JavaScript prototypes) while the less advanced students can put themselves through the queue system on CURRI and get some personal help from the instructors.
