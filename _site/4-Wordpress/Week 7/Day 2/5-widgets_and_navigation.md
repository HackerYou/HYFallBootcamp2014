# Widgets and Navigation

## Widgets
Widgets are self-contained content areas in a theme. Wordpress has several built-in widgets like: blogroll, comments, search form, calendar, tag cloud, RSS, Categories, archive, etc. We can of course create our very own widgets.

You will need the following section of the codex:
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets

**Exercise**
Open up the widget interface in the Wordpress dashboard and add at least two widgets to your website. Experiment with removing and adding widgets.

## Navigation

With Wordpress we can create navigation menus that can be modified from the admin interface. 

The following sections of the codex will be handy:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Menus_SubPanel
http://codex.wordpress.org/Navigation_Menus

**Exercise**
Explore the navigation menu interface in the admin dashboard. Add a few links to test the system out.
