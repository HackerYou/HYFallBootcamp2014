# Client Requests / Challenges

Week 7 & 8 will introduce Wordpress but also require you to combine your HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. The following challenges should be tackled in pairs whenever you have time. The requests/challenges can seem a bit vague but that's how many client requests will be. Try a solution and then talk to an instructor if you want feedback.

Note that you don't need a fresh Wordpress installation for these challenges, you can work in your existing environment.

* Your client who sells handcrafted jewelry needs an e-commerce shop attached to their website. They want to be able to easily add and remove items from the shop, see a list of purchases, see shipping information, etc.
* Your client is a photographer who wants a website to showcase her work. She wants a simple admin interface that allows her to easily add, remove and edit the showcase.
* Your client is the editor of an online magazine. To increase the reading rate, the client wants a thumbnail image associated with each article. The image should be added through a field like the post title and should automatically appear on the front-end.
* The same magazine wants an author box with the author's image and bio at the end of each blog post.
* Your client is a social media company who need an image slider on the front page of their Wordpress website.
* Your client is a paranormal consultant who would like to publish his scientific research on his website. Instead of selling his book he would rather offer it for free. To increase his readership he would like his audience to tweet about the book before getting it (pay with a tweet!).
* Your client is organizing a conference so they would like you to add a Twitter widget that streams the conversations that use the conference's preferred hashtag.
* The same conference organizer wants to make it simple for attendees to find the venue so they are requesting that you embed a google map to the website.
* Instead of showing recent blog entries on the homepage your client would like a custom page welcoming visitors to the website.
* Your client would like a contact form on their Wordpress website.
* Your client moved their existing blog from a different platform over to Wordpress. Fortunately all of the comments and discussions were done using Disqus.com so they don't have to start all over. Your task is to turn off the default Wordpress comments and enable Disqus.com comments.
* Your client is a prolific blogger who cross posts an excerpt on Twitter to promote each blog post. She would love it if this process could be automated for her. This means that a Tweet goes out automatically every time she blogs.
