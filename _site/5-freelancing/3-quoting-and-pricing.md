# Quoting and Pricing

Quoting is one of the hardest things about being a freelancer. Most freelancers hate quoting as putting a price on their skill isn't cut and clear and there are really no firm answers.

## How much should I charge?

I usually tell new freelancers, figure out how much you want to charge, then _double it_.

What? Double?! Why?

Many new freelancers make the following mistakes on their first few projects:

1. Undervalue their talents
2. Under estimate the amount of time a project will take
3. Base their rate on a previous office job where they didn't have to worry about any taxes or expenses. 

Don't make these mistakes. We will now go into both *how to price yourself* as well as *how to prepare a quote*.

## Determining your hourly

Even if you won't be charging by the hour, its important to figure out what a general hour of your time will be worth. This is a very important base that you will then use to make many decisions from.

What should your hourly rate be? Well, if you used to make $70,000 a year an office job, your effective rate would be about $33 an hour for a 9-5 m-f job. 

Should you just charge $33/ hour and go from there? *no!* You need to consider that hours in the day aren't the same as **billable hours* So, whereas an office job you would get paid for 8 hours of ass-in-seat time, as a developer you need to consider:

* Time spent on phone calls
* Time spend traveling to meetings
* Time in meetings
* Time spent networking and at events
* Time spent on personal branding - twitter / blogging / speaking
* Time spent learning new things
* Time spend on business planning and taxes

So, you shouldn't expect to get a full 8 hours billable a day. Some hours you may have 0 billable hours, some you might be lucky to get 6. Almost all days, you will have to do any of the above that are unrelated to client projects.

So, how do you determind your hourly rate? I'd say at the end of this class you will all be $60/hour developers. Then, as get busy with client work, you slowly raise your rates until things stabilize. 

Most developers are afraid to raise their rates because they will think clients will balk at their prices. **This is not true.** Be confident in yourself and charge what you are worth. 

## Billing hourly
Now that you know your hourly rate, should you just bill hourly? 

Probably not, hourly billing isn't great for delivering an entire website as:

1. It is hard to gage how long a website will take you
2. A client will want to know how long something will take and are often very hesitant to let go willy nilly hourly billing. 

So, when would you bill hourly?

When the scope of the project is fuzzy or undefined.

1. When working with a team of developers at an agency/company. It is too hard to gage how long something will take because there are too many moving parts that you don't have control over. Instead of giving them a fixed quote, you can let them know you will be working at an hourly rate of $XX. Sometimes if they can offer you a block of at least 20 hours, you can offer a discount as the hours are guaranteed and you will be billing for things like meetings and phone calls. 
2. When a client needs something fixed or explored. You will have random clients who needs something on their website fixed. Since you didn't create the website, you have no idea how long it would take to fix. In these situations I like to say "It will take 1-4 hours, with a promise of not going over 4 hours.". This way the client knows the worst case and you are able to get paid for your time accurately.

## Billing by project / by value

Quoting and billing by project is much more common for freelancers as in most situations it is preferable by both parties. 

Clients like to know exactly how much a project will cost. Clients often aren't sure how long something should take or if $60/hour is too much. So they can make the decision on the project based on what they will get in return for a fixed price. 

Freelancers prefer to bill by a fixed price so they have the flexibility to work on the project at their own pace. If you want to work really quickly and earn extra $$, you can. If you wish to take your time and learn as you go, go can. 

## Value based billing
This brings us to the next point of value based billing. Don't charge for how long the project takes you, but for the value that you are brining to the client. 

Efficient developers speed up their workflow by creating tools (boilerplate code, snippets, helper functions) that allow them to get the same scope of work done in half the time. Just because you are a fast coder, doesn't mean you should charge less for your projects.

This also applies to code you have already written. You will find yourself writing the same code over and over again, why not re-use it? 

For example, you spend 30 hours writing a store locater and get paid $1800 for it ($60/hour). 

Then, your next client wants something similar. If it takes you 5 hours to implement it on their website, what should you charge? $300? Or $1800? 

THe amount is up to you, but you definitely should not be charging only for your time. You have created an asset which brings value to the client. If client #1 would spend $1800 on it, client #2 will almost definitely spend $1800 on it as well. Rinse and repeat. 

You will start to think of your websites as very modular bits. Code a twitter widget once, put it on 10 websites.

The client doesn't care how long it takes you. In fact, they will be happy that you get it to them sooner as you didn't have to code it all. 

## Billing and Learning 

Next up is the opposite end of the spectrum. What if you are working on something new, and need some time to learn it? How should you quote on this project? 

This is a fairly common occurrence. Freelancers need to constantly be teaching themselves new things, so there will be times where you quote on a project and plan to "eat" or "write off" a certain number of hours. So if a 10-ish hour website actually takes you 16 because you were learning along the way, just chalk it up to time learning and not towards the client's project.

When you get really specialized, a client might come to you asking if some bleeding-edge technology is capable of what they want to do. This exploratory research should be billed for. 

## How to come up with a quote

Q: How much is a 1 page website?
A: $100 - 100,000

Figuring out how much to charge is a skill that needs to be learned. There are no set rules on how much things cost and there are no baselines. There are, however, some tricks you can use to figure out what your ballpark should be.

### Step 1: Figure out what the site will and will not include
This is absolutely the first thing you need to do. Before you even ballpark a number to a client, you need to figure out what the site will entail. Ask as many questions as possible:

1. What will the site need to include?
2. Will a design be supplied? Or do we need to quote on a design?
3. If you need a design, do you need a logo?
2. What are the pages of the website? 
3. What will go on each page?
4. Other than displaying content, what does the website _need to do_?
4. Do you need a contact form? Maps? Store locater? 
5. Who will insert the content? Who will update the site when it needs to be done?

In addition to asking about what it will include, sell them on things that will increase the scope and make the project fun for you:

6. Will the site include any sort of social media integration?
5. Will the website be based on WordPress or another CMS? (I often recommend this to the client as they aren't sure if they need it)
7. Does the site need to be responsive? (recommend / insist / assume this)

### Step 2: Break it down into major functional areas

Breaking the project into smaller modular pieces makes it much easier to estimate the cost of something. 

Let's use <http://wesbos.com> for this breakdown:

*Base Project* - What does it cost for your to get out of bed, setup the wordpress, create all the pages and code the base HTML shell of the website?  

*Home Page* - Custom layout including a dynamic pulling from the blog section

*Static Content Pages* - regular content without a fancy layout. About, contact, etc...

*Blog* - Styling of the entire blog. Everything from the latest posts to categories to the individual post.

*Work* - Custom layout of my latest portfolio items


*Speaking and Training* - Dynamic and backend-editable listing of all speaking and training I perform. It automatically archives speaking/training once the date has past. 

### Step 3: Approximate how long each section should take you

Now that you have everything broken into manageable sections, go through each section and estimate how long each piece will take you: 


**Base Project** - 10 hours
**Home Page** - 5 hours
**Static Content Pages** - 3 hours
**Blog** - 5 hours
**Work** - 4 hours
**Speaking and Training** - 6 hours

Have no idea how long something might take? Quoting is an art and not a hard skill. You will get better at quoting as you go along. Sometimes you will get burned on your estimate and go way over. This is simply part of learning to be a freelancer. 


### Step 4: Add it up, add 20%

A total of 33 hours. If you are working at $60/hour that is $1980.

Factor in 20% extra for over-delivering. Clients always remember small things that they want to be added. Instead of them feeling like they are getting nickel and dimed for extra hours of work, think ahead and include that in the quote. They will then be really glad that you are going above and beyond to make them happy. 

So, total of $2,376.

### A few notes:

1. Some clients may wish to have larger projects quoted in separate bits. How much extra is responsive? What if we want to include a store? These things can be quoted separately as add-ons. 
1. Do not include HST in your price. This is assumed in Canada and you don't need to feel bad that you charge HST.
2. You may offer a discount for not-for-profits. For this, quote the full amount and then show a deducted amount after it so they know they are getting a deal.

## What to include in a quote
Your quote will end up being a document that includes the following sub-headings:

1. **General project description** stating what this quote will cover.
2. **Major site areas** — take the modular functional areas from above and go into detail as to what each will include and will not include
3. **Browser suppor**t - what browsers will your support? What devices? 
4. **Timelines** — when will the project be completed? Based your timelines in weeks/days from the acceptance of the quote. 
5. **Revisions** - How many times can they come back to you with feedback on what to change? Be specific about how they should deliver it (email followed by a phonecall). This is very important because otherwise the client will be emailing you with every thought that pops into their head.
6. **Training** - How will the client learn to use the site? Do you provide documentation? I like to use a screen recording program and walk through the entire site and backend updating options. 

## Worrying

Think you are charging too much? Everyone does. Quit worrying. 

Put together a fair and honest quote, don't discount it because you think they won't go for it. Submit the quote to them with full confidence. 

Most of the time, the quote will be accepted. It's just how much a website costs.  

Sometimes the client just won't be able to afford it. If that is the case, simply ask them what their top budget would be and propose a website that would meet that budget. Refining the scope and proposing a solution will make for a happy client.
