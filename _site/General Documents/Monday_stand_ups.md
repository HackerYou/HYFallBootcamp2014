# Monday Stand-ups

"Stand ups" are very popular in agile software development. These are "status updates" where team members can very quickly talk about what they have accomplished, what they would like to accomplish and what obstacles or difficulties they are experiencing. Many agile agencies have daily stand ups. We will do a stand up **every Monday morning at 10:00 AM**. 

The whole class will literally "stand up", form a circle, and each get a couple of minutes to answer three questions:

1. What did you accomplish last week?
2. What will you accomplish this week?
3. What obstacles/blocks are impeding your progress?

The point of the stand up is to:

1. build accountability and trust
2. know what others are working on
3. know what problems people are having (if you share the same problem then collaborate to solve it. If you know the solution then offer to help.)

## Tips

* Keep your responses short and to the point.
* Prepare for it...you know that this will happen every week so it's not a surprise.
* Wait until after the stand up to discuss things. A stand up is just a "status update".
