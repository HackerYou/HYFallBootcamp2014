# Lesson Plan

There are several "lesson plan" documents distributed across the notes. The information in this document is relevant to all lessons. Information relevant to say only Wordpress will be put in the Wordpress folder. If information is only relevant for a specific week then you will find it in the week's folder. If information is only relevant for a specific day then you will find it in the appropriate day folder. The idea is to only give you information that you need.

## Terminology

"Lesson" means a lecture or an activity that is directly supervised by the instructor. An "exercise" involves students doing some exploration. An "exercise" could be in the form of a "fake" client request or just a prompt/question that points students in the general direction they should be heading. Of course these types of lessons involve a bit of chaos and that's a good thing!

## Morning

Get together briefly at around 10 am every morning to:

* Respond to students' self-assessment feedback.
* Encourage students to keep thinking about and monitoring their learning.
* Go over the agenda for the day.
* Remind students to make good use of their time. If they finish the activities early then they should spend the rest of the time working on their own projects.

The self-assessment information is aggregated so it will help you get a general idea for how the class is feeling. If people are feeling great then that's a nod to push forward. If people are not feeling well then address the learning expectations that they are struggling with. This can be in the form of an impromptu lesson or Q/A session. This might mean that you push new content over to another day.

## Time Blocks

It is very hard to predict how long a lesson or exercise might take to complete. The schedule is therefore broken down into two blocks: 10 am to 3 pm (includes lunch) and 3 pm to 6 pm. Each block has one or two lessons/exercises. You will need to decide how much time to give for each lesson/exercise. Your predictions will get better as the course progresses because you'll:

* know which kind of exercises students prefer
* how long Q/A sessions typically take
* how much time students want for working on their weekly projects
* and so on...

## Responding to Question Queue 

CURRI allows students to "toggle" a help switch and add themselves to a queue. Instructors can then go through the queue when they have time. Students are more likely to ask for help this way and help is fairly distributed. If a student asks for help outside of the queue then it's highly recommended that you politely ask them use the queue system to keep requests in one place.

## End of Day

Students should be given the last ~1 hour of the day to do some self-assessment. If it's a busy day then it might be reasonable to leave this for students to do on their own time at home.
